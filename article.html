            Thursday, January 24th
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes, I wish they all knew that I’d saved the world, that “we” had saved the world. I don’t wish it to be vain, I don’t think I am vain. I mean to make such a statement with a hundred percent certainty would be a paradox, wouldn’t it? Can you really be the judge of your own vanity? I don’t know, I didn’t think so. It didn’t even matter, I’d seen the real nature of the world and trust me, morality didn’t matter. I was not a good person, I knew that, even if I tried not to do bad things. I did not aspire to be a good person. It’s just, sometimes I wish the world didn’t take me for -
            <br>
            <br>
            My therapist says that I have a bad habit of avoiding things that I don’t like. I have a tendency to skip words, names, conversations, ev- I can’t argue with her there, most of the time I skip through entire therapy sessions. It’s like I’m at the beginning and then I’m at the end. And I’m aware that I’ve just sat through an hour of this woman saying nonsense at me. But I don’t really remember what the nonsense was and I’m far too lazy to try to remember.
            <br>
            <br>
            She didn’t say that to me today though, that was a few sessions back. Today was different from our other sessions. She didn’t ask me mundane questions like she always did (I mean she asked but it was just at the beginning) and then cut our session short when there was nothing else to say and I wasn’t being too responsive. In fact, we almost spent the whole hour, come to think of it, we’ve almost spent the full hour the past three sessions, although I couldn’t really remember what we’d talked about in them. That doesn’t mean it was a good session though, far from it. I think I’m going to die soon.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m not going to kill myself. I’m not suicidal. I don’t go to therapy because I’m depressed, although I am, that’s just not the reason why I go. I go to therapy because of my difficulty at sleeping and the nightmares and also for my tendency to avoid people. Although I think the last one’s a pretty normal response. People are evil, I stay away. Simple as that. What I meant was, those things are finally going to find me and kill me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maybe I shouldn’t really think about it, I shouldn’t write about them. No point worrying about something I won’t really be able to change. Right?
           <br>
           <br>
            I think today might be a short entry in this journal. I don’t really have much to say. Or I could write about my therapy session. I’ll just write about that instead.
            <br>
            <br>
            She asked me how my day was going, somewhere around the beginning. I stared at her face for a minute while trying to choose my words. She stared right back at me. Maybe they taught her at therapy school that breaking eye contact with a patient was admitting defeat or something. She just kept staring at me with a huge smile that made her plump cheeks look plumper. I settled for, “It’s going okay.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Three whole words, someone’s chatty today,” she said and laughed. Yeah, she’s one of those kinds of people. The kind that laughs a lot at their own unfunny jokes. She had a slight American or British accent though, which made it a little bearable. I’m not sure why. I always imagined her father was a rich corrupt politician who had sent her abroad to some fancy University to get a fancy therapy degree. He had sent her to study medicine at first but she couldn’t stand the sight of blood and had ended up switching majors. But her University days were long behind her now. All that was left to her now was her job and her fiancé that kept delaying their wedding because he was probably cheating on her. Just those two things and this miserable country. Why had she even come back here? Because she didn’t want to be one of those Nigerians that abandoned their “beautiful” homeland once they left the country. She’d been so stupid; this country was a joke and you didn’t get the punchline unless you were filthy rich and most likely corrupt. Her father had stopped giving her monthly allowances almost as soon as he had helped fund her therapy practice. That was years ago though. And besides, she didn’t need her father’s or even her useless fiancé’s money. She could take care of herself. It was just hard. Life was hard, she knew that.
            <br>
            <br>
            If I had the chance though, I wouldn’t make that mistake. If I ever left this country, I’d never come back.
            <br>
            <br>
            She asked me if I saw or did anything fun today. I thought about it. I saw an Angel beat and then disembowel a child today. The boy must have been about nine or ten years old. He had screamed and cried right up until the angel started to feed on his entrails. Everyone around just kept on walking and going about their normal business as if nothing was wrong. My mum just kept on singing along to her gospel album as she drove me to my therapy session. She couldn’t see them; nobody could see them. My Uncle had told me that when I first told him about the things I saw. It had been horrifying to see and definitely not fun so I answered “no”.
            <br>
            <br>
            She had looked at me for a while, not saying anything. I wanted to read her mind and know what she was thinking about this weird kid sitting in front of her. I wanted to tell her that I’d saved the world. “We” had saved the world. But I convinced myself that I didn’t need her approval. She wouldn’t believe me anyway, and I turned to stare at the walls. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’ve looked at the walls so many times in that office that I know every inch of it. I’ve stared at every graduation photo, a framed degree from oxford, a couple-photos of her and her fiancé. There used to be a lot of photos of them when I first started going there. They started coming down one by one, now there was just three.
            <br>
            <br>
            She asked me how school was going. Sometimes I wonder if being honest with her would actually be helpful. If she could actually understand me. Wasn’t that her job? To understand me. No. Her job was to make me better. There’s a difference. There is. Because “better” is subjective. If I was honest with her, her job would be to first convince me that I was crazy.
            <br>
            <br>
            I tell her school is going fine. Obviously, it’s not. I hate it every day. I have no friends, by choice of course. Why would I want to be friends with any of those people? People are evil and kids are the worst. Cruel for no reason other than to have something to laugh at. Pass a half-empty bottle of Fanta for the boys in class to spit in and then give it to a girl to give it to the new kid to drink. Always making fun of the new kid because he has really bad acne. All they do is laugh and laugh. Then when he starts to cry, act like it’s all his fault because he can’t take a joke. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Yeah, school was going fine. Whatever.
            <br>
            <br>
            She asked me if I was excited about my birthday coming up. No, I wasn’t. Birthdays were the fucking worst. I knew this. Yet every single year when it came around, deep down, I always expected that one to be the one that something amazing happened. I mean, I have just one day, one day in a year that’s mine. Is it too much to ask to be happy on one day? Is it too much to ask your parents to not forget that one day? Or when they manage to remember to not throw some stupid party where the only people that show up is your sister and your asshole brother and they force you to dance even though they all know how much you hate doing that. Is it too much to ask to feel good on one day? Is it too much to ask to be special?
            <br>
            <br>
            I turn sixteen next month and the best birthday I can remember was when I was seven. My Uncle had woken me up that Saturday singing me a happy birthday. He had told me we could do whatever we wanted to do and he wasn’t lying. We spent the day eating ice cream and playing games at a game centre. And when I came home there was cake and my parents had gotten me this remote-control toy car. I knew it was my Uncle that told them to get it for me. He was the only one I kept telling how much I wanted that car. I spoilt the car the next day. I told my Uncle because he was the only one I knew wouldn’t yell at me. I took the spoilt car to him crying, trying and failing to stop the catarrh running down my nose. He just laughed and took the car from my hand. He brought it back for me later, he had fixed it. I don’t like to think about my Uncle. When I do, I feel like the loneliest person in the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            “You sound like you miss him very much,” she said.
            <br>
            <br>
            Shit. I’d thought. I didn’t know I said any of that out loud. I didn’t know when that had started to happen, when my thoughts had started to escape my head and leak into the real world. “He’s my Uncle and he’s dead,” I had said to her. “Don’t you have dead loved ones that you miss?” He had been my best friend.
            <br>
            <br>
            She had a weird look on her face, like I was saying things that weren’t adding up. I was a hundred percent sure I’d only thought that last sentence. Telling people that your Uncle who had been dead for years was your best friend was beyond weird, even if they were your therapist. Then another look came on her face and she asked, “Do you… do you know how your Uncle passed?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t know the details. When my parents told me that my Uncle had died, I had asked them what happened. They always told me different things. Like they kept forgetting the lies they told me the first time. So they kept telling me the closest thing to the last story they’d told. And on and on it went, approximations of approximations. Till the stories stopped resembling themselves. Till they finally yelled at me to stop asking. I remember all their approximations though; I remember all their lies. First, he’d had an accident when he was travelling on the road to Lagos, then it was to Port Harcourt. Then there had been an armed robbery on the road and he had been shot and killed, then he had been kidnapped and taken somewhere and then killed. Lies. I knew it was the Angels doing this. It was only them that worked this kind of magic. Magic that twisted the mind of human beings so they could never see what really went on in the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            I told her I didn’t really know how he died. I hadn’t been with him that day, though sometimes I wish had, even if it meant I would have died too. I wanted to tell her I knew other things though, bigger things. Things that had been blocked from the eyes of every human on the planet so they could remain docile and continue to be food. My eyes were open. I could see them. The Angels and the Daemons and their hunger that had almost ended the world. They were what my Uncle had died stopping.
            <br>
            <br>
            To be honest, I don’t mind that my parents don’t really know how my Uncle died, it’s probably for the best. My Uncle says the Angels are ruthless to people who don’t bend to their magic and the Daemons are worse. They eliminate you in the worst way possible. First, they make you go mad so that no one believes your ramblings, so that everyone thinks the only place you belong in is an asylum. And then they kill you. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Why I get angry at my parents is that they refuse to even talk about him at all. Sometimes, I just wanted to hear about the good times, how he’d pick me up whenever he came around the house, how when my parents were too busy, he’d pick me from school and buy me yoghurt on our way home, how him and my dad were always reminiscing about some fun childhood memory and were constantly laughing. I missed their laughs together, the baritone melody of it. I always wanted to participate in it, even though I barely understood what they were talking about. It sounded like happiness. How could they never talk about him? He was their family; he was their friend. Maybe the memory of him was just too painful for them, he was only twenty-six when he died. Young and so full of potential. Now I was going to die the same. Young.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Why don’t you tell me more about the Angels and Daemons?”
            <br>
            <br>
            When she asked me that it felt like more than just cold water, it felt like a cold bath on a harmattan morning. It felt deadly. What was going on here? How had she known that? Could she read my thoughts? Did she work for them? Was she one of them? No. That wasn’t plausible. That’s not how they worked. They didn’t read thoughts. They couldn’t disguise themselves as humans. They just made themselves invisible to us.
            <br>
            <br>
            “How… What are you talking about?” I asked.
            <br>
            <br>
            “The Angels,” She’d said. “You told me about them in our last session and I told you we’d continue this week. Don’t you remember?”
            <br>
            <br>
            No. This made no sense. Why would I do that? Why would I do that? Except I was – No. Why would I do that? I knew the consequences. I know the consequences. Why would I – 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Are you okay?” She’d asked me. “You look like you’re having some kind of panic attack”
            <br>
            <br>
            “You can’t… you can’t tell anybody about this. Not even my parents.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Of course not,” She said. Did she lie to me? “Everything you say here is between you and me. You know that.”
            <br>
            <br>
            I stared at her face for a while. I searched for disbelief in her eyes. I couldn’t find any.
            <br>
            <br>
            “What did I say to you about them?” I finally asked. “Before.”
            <br>
            <br>
            She nodded her head as if to say “okay” before she spoke. “You asked me if I believed that things could exist and I just couldn’t see them. I said ‘Yes. I believe in God and I can’t see Him.’ Then you asked if I believed in angels and demons and I said yes. And you said what If you told me that they lived right here among us and they were all just as bad, would I believe it? I said I’d be intrigued; I’d like to know more. Then our time ran out and I said we’d continue this week. And now here we are.”
            <br>
            <br>
            I hadn’t told her very much. I could have still salvaged it. I could have still saved myself. Saved both of us.
            <br>
            <br>
            “I’m really curious, though. Why do you feel Angels are just as bad as Demons?” She’d asked.
            <br>
            <br>
            I don’t know what came over me or why I said what I said. With a sentence, I sealed both our fates. “Because I’ve seen it.”
            <br>
            <br>
            She was not as shocked as I’d expected her to be. “You’ve seen Angels?” She asked.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Yes,” I replied.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Where?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Everywhere?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Demons too?
            <br>
            <br>
            “Daemons. Yes.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “And what do they do?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Eat.”
            <br>
            <br>
            She pauses for a while as if afraid to pull further on this thread. Maybe she could sense that it wasn’t just my sanity that could come at stake.
            <br>
            <br>
            “What do they eat?” She finally asked.
            <br>
            <br>
            I said, “Us.”
            <br>
            <br>
            She stared at me. I stared at her.
            <br>
            <br>
            “And you’ve seen this happen?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “I saw one today. Beat and disembowel a child and then eat him, by the side of the road while everyone walked on.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “You saw a Daemon do this?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “No. An Angel.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “An Angel?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I nodded my head. She was clearly very shocked. Maybe she felt this was too blasphemous or some other bullshit. Daemons and Angels killed and ate people, but from a certain “moral” point of view, you could argue that Angels were worse. Daemons eat anybody, anyone they can find when they are hungry, they eat people, and even Angels and other Daemons I once saw two Daemons tear themselves apart in the middle of a road surrounded by crashed cars. But Angels, they fed on only one thing, children. Apart from the way they looked, this was one of their few differences. Another was how they manipulated the illusions they used to blind the world from them. Daemons used rage, anger, hate as fuel. Wherever a Daemon or Daemons fed, you would always find chaos, violence, wars. Angels on the other hand used other things, feelings, passions that were more guarded in the human heart. Things like jealousy, ignorance, lust and all those misguided emotions people mistake for love, and maybe even love itself. That way, an Angel didn’t need to be in the presence of conflict to feed. It fed right next to you as you walked by. My Uncle had taught me all this.
            <br>
            <br>
            I wasn’t going to tell her all this though. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “When was the first time you saw an Angel? What do they look like?”
            <br>
            <br>
            She seemed to be particularly focused on the Angels. I remained silent. I didn’t want to talk about this, I shouldn’t be talking about this. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “You can tell me,” She said.
            <br>
            <br>
            I don’t know why I kept talking. At this point, I didn’t know why I was doing anything I was doing. “The first time I saw an Angel was when I was about six. It had silver skin, scaly, almost reptilian like. I was in my room by myself playing with some toy, my older siblings had gone to visit some of their neighborhood friends, I wasn’t allowed to leave the house. I noticed the smell first. It was like some kind of strong perfume that was suddenly all around me, choking me. Like all the air in the world was gone and all that was left was this toxic scent. Then I noticed its huge body on the wall of my room. I can never forget it. It was like a giant silver snake with legs and huge silver wings and a giant tail that just kept wagging. I can’t remember it’s face though. Maybe it was so messed up that my mind blocked it. I know it was glaring at me. I screamed when I saw it. I would have died that day if my Uncle hadn’t come into the room. He must have smelled its scent too. I remember he rushed into the room and said a few words in some language and it just hissed and vanished into thin air. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “He hugged me for a long time while I cried and cried. And tried to explain what I saw to me. ‘I’d been given a gift,’ he had said. ‘The Sight only people like prophets in the Bible had been blessed with.’ Though I didn’t quite get it until years later. He told me why it was too dangerous to tell anyone. Why I should keep what I just saw to myself or another one might come back.” I stopped there. I didn’t want to go into more details about my Uncle. I didn’t want to talk about him. I didn’t want to tell her about the Catholic Order he used to belong to. About all the things they taught him about the Angels and Daemons and the magics they used to fight them; magics he had said he would teach me before he died. I didn’t want to tell her about how he left the Catholic Order because of their own hypocrisy and unwillingness to take a bolder stance against these monsters. And back then was different. Back then all the portals were open and They kept pouring into this world in legions.
            <br>
            <br>
            She had stared at me for a long time when I stopped talking. In shock, I think. I wasn’t sure. Her face was like a petri dish for emotions and my job was to determine them, carry out tests, experiments and see which ones checked out. Her eyes had a glossy look in them like she was about to cry, why was she sad? Her mouth was slightly ajar like she was about to say something but didn’t know quite what to say, so she was also confused.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, she said, “Have you been taking your-” She stopped. Then continued, “Wait, so you’ve been seeing people get eaten?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Yes.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Aren’t you afraid? Don’t you want to help them?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “No.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Because people are just as bad. Give them a chance and they won’t fail to show you just how terrible they can be. Don’t you watch the news? Don’t you see all the terrible things we do to each other? You think the guy walking past you won't beat you to death or do something worse if you just put him in the right conditions? Give him the right excuses?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Not… not everyone is bad, some people do good.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Some people try to do good and most of the time it’s motivated by some selfish desire, even though they lie to themselves that it’s not. They do good things so other people will like them, so they can be called good people, kind people, so they can wear their goodness like a crown.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Don’t you think you’re too young to have such unshakable… resolutions about life? You’re just fifteen. You haven’t really experienced much about life.”
            <br>
            <br>
            And there she went, playing the adult card like it was some instant badge of knowledge. Like most adults weren’t old and stupid. I was almost sixteen and I had seen and experienced things she couldn’t even begin to imagine. I had experienced loss more profound than anything that she had ever experienced. I had done so much, accomplished so much, suffered so much for her and so many other people. She should have been grateful to me. I was more adult than she could ever –
            <br>
            <br>
            “What was that?” She asked.
            <br>
            <br>
            “What?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “You whispered something under your breath.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “I didn’t say anyth-”
            <br>
            <br>
            “You said you saved the world.”
            <br>
            <br>
            I hadn’t… “I didn’t say anything.”
            <br>
            <br>
            She started to stare at me again. I didn’t know what she was thinking and it was starting to making me very uncomfortable. I think she was trying to choose the right words to say next but we were silent for what felt like minutes. And when I couldn’t take the silence any longer, I decided to say something.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Do you want to know the first time I really saw what evil looked like? Before I even knew what that word meant.”
            <br>
            <br>
            She didn’t say anything. She only nodded her head.
            <br>
            <br>
            “My family always used to watch TV together every night. It was kind of our family ritual. After dinner, my parents would let us watch cartoons until nine o'clock when it was time for the local news. Then they would change the channel and we would all watch the news together. Me and my siblings usually found it extremely boring and we would begin to doze off one by one and my parents would chase us inside to go and sleep. Late one night, we were watching the news with my father. I must have been around nine or ten then. My mother called him to help her with something she was doing in the kitchen, so he left us. My brother and sister started asking me to change the channel back to the cartoon we were watching. I wouldn’t do it. I knew they just wanted me to be the one to receive the ass whooping when my father came back and found that we had changed the channel. They kept telling me that I was the youngest and our father wouldn’t beat me. I’d received enough beatings at that point to know that their logic was invalid. That was when it came on, on the news.
            <br>
            <br>
            “There was an image of a man and beneath the image was written ‘Timothy Scott-Ogbon. 26’. I don’t think I can ever forget that name or his face. His dark-skinned face was covered in so much sweat and wounds that weren’t healing properly, riddled with white-spotted acne, pus was oozing from every single one of them. His face never left me. How could it? This was the face of evil. He had repeatedly molested a child for years and convinced the child not to tell anyone, especially the child’s parents He’d been a priest, someone everyone in the community had trusted. Back then, I didn’t even know what the word ‘molest’ meant but somehow I knew that it connoted something deeply wrong. I remember my brother looking over at me. I thought he was going to say something mean like he usually did, like how the man was going to crawl out of the TV and chase me. He didn’t say anything though. Probably because at that moment my father came back into the living room. And after he saw what was on the news, he quickly changed it. Like he was embarrassed he had left his children alone to watch such a horrible thing. He put it on our cartoon channel and that was what we watched until we slept that night. I didn’t stop thinking about that man though, I never did. I never forgot his face. Till today I still see it in some of my nightmares, crawling out of our old TV to get me.”
            <br>
            <br>
            When I was done, I didn’t need to guess what my therapist was feeling. Tears was heavy in one of her eyes. She struggled to speak for a few minutes before finally doing so.
            <br>
            <br>
            “How do you think your Uncle died?” She asked me again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “You’ve already asked me that,” I replied.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Okay. Then tell me, what was the last memory you have of him? The last time you saw him?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t understand what her intention was here. What was she trying to prove? Was she trying to get me to say things so she could tell me how ridiculous I sounded? Was that her plan? But then, how could she possibly have known what happened the last time I saw my Uncle?
            <br>
            <br>
            “It’s okay. You can tell me. You can trust me.” 
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t trust her. But I spoke anyway. “The last time I saw my Uncle. We were trying to close the portals when Daemons attacked. He masked me from them and led them away. I never saw him again.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Portals?” She had looked so perplexed.
            <br>
            <br>
            “I don’t want to talk about this anymore. You’re just going to say I’m crazy.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Look at me.” I’d looked at her. “I don’t think you’re crazy. Talk to me.”
            <br>
            <br>
            I wondered if she honestly believed me or if that was just a thing she was trained to say to her patients. And that was all I was to her, another one of her patients. I found that funny, that in this messed up world that we lived in I was the one that people doubted. I wanted to give her my eyes, let her witness the things I’ve witnessed and see if she had the strength to remain sane. Maybe that’s why they couldn’t see, maybe their brains couldn’t handle. But why did I keep talking? Telling her these things. I was probably tired of all the years of keeping everything to myself, of processing every disturbing thing I saw those monsters do on my own. On my own, maybe that was it, I was tired of being al-
            <br>
            <br>
            “Back then it was different, the whole world was different, even if you couldn’t see it, I’m sure you must have felt it. The world must have felt more dangerous or perhaps just a little less safe. See, there had been so many portals open then. Portals were like bridges to the heaven and hell dimension and the Angels and Daemons were just flooding in, killing so many people and blinding us with their magic. Covering it up with plane crashes and wars and terrorism and stuff like that. And my Uncle was going to put a stop to it. He had gathered scriptures and books and spells from so many places and he was going to shut all the portals everywhere. And the way the portals closed was like suction, so all the Angels and Daemons near them would have just been sucked inside.
            <br>
            <br>
            “We’d practiced the spells together over and over again for over a year so we’d get it perfect when it was time to do it. And when the day came, that was when they attacked. I don’t know how they found out. One minute, we were in my room and the next, the door flew open and the Daemons were everywhere, on the ground, on the walls everywhere. My Uncle barely had time to throw an invisibility spell on me, let alone himself. The Daemons are like the Angels in a way, they look like huge seven-foot long lizards. The difference is that while the Angels have almost beautiful silver scales that make them look kind of majestic, like some kind of dragons, the Daemons scales are a very dull brown that looks very dirty. They look like they’ve been rolling around in mud or some gutter full of shit, which would explain their horrid stench. It was like you could die just by being in their presence, just by inhaling them.
            <br>
            <br>
            They attacked my Uncle over and over again, leaping at him, clawing at him so hard that blood and faeces was all I could smell. He could barely deflect their attacks. He would have died there. But finally, he made for the broken door and ran. Three days later, all the portals closed and my Uncle was dead.”
            <br>
            <br>
            When I was done, my therapist was crying. Tears rolled gently down her cheek. It’s quite obvious she didn’t know what to say. She opened her mouth to speak, then closed it, then opened it again and then closed it. I understood. Anytime I thought of the memory, it’s like I was there again. A helpless nine-year old screaming and crying. My Uncle must have blocked out any sound coming from me too because the Daemons didn’t even so much as look my way. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, she’d asked, “Have you been taking your medication?”
            <br>
            <br>
            It hit me like a slap on the face. After everything I’d said, all the woman could ask is if I’m taking my sleeping pills. Was she trying to say all of this was just my nightmares or something? All of this was just some stupid lucid dreams. What did I even expect? If I were in her shoes, that’s what I would have believed too. She hadn’t seen what I’d seen, how could she possibly understand. I’d always be alo-
            <br>
            <br>
            “Have you?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “I only take them sometimes. I don’t like how they make me feel.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “You have to take the drugs every day. They aren’t something you only take when you feel like or they won’t work.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Like I’d guessed. True to her job, first she’d tell me I was crazy. I couldn’t even be angry. All I was, was disappointed. I slumped back in my chair.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Are you listening to me?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I nodded my head, “I was just joking. It was all a joke.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Her eyes were staring intently at me, like she was taking apart my skull and looking right into my mind. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “I don’t believe you,” She’d said. I was already losing interest in this conversation. “If you were just joking, then what is your Uncle’s name?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I looked at her. She had thrown a hook into my brain and pulled my attention. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Why did you always have to be there when your Uncle wanted to practice his spells?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t respond.
            <br>
            <br>
            “It seems he could have cast his world-saving spell without you. Why did he have to endanger a child he cared about?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t respond.
            <br>
            <br>
            “What part did you actually have to play in it?”
            <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t respond.
            <br>
            <br>
            “How exactly did you save the world?”
            <br>
            <br>
            Heat was bubbling in me, rising from my stomach, gathering in my chest. Something was burning in me. Anger. 
            <br>
            <br>
            “Your Uncle was arrested. We’ve gone through this before. He hung himself in his cell.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Why the hell was she lying to me? Why was she crying? Why was she fucking lying to me?
            <br>
            <br>
            “I’m not lying to you.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Your Uncle’s name is-”
            <br>
            <br>
            I got up from the chair, hung my bag and walked out of the office. And that was the end of it. My therapist spoke to my mother before she drove me home. My next session is supposed to be in three weeks but I won’t be going. Like I said, I’ll be dead by then. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m sure my therapist must have told my mother all about what I said and she would have told my father. And it won’t take long before word reaches Their ears that a boy knows something that he is not supposed to know. Maybe it’s better this way. Maybe it’s better. I’m going to stop here and go to sleep. If I’m lucky, I’ll be dead before I wake in the morning.

            <h4>When I drove into the school compound in my beat-up grey Datsun that chilly and wet Monday morning I had little idea what awaited me in that venerated public institution. I brought the car to a slow stop under the mighty oak tree where I usually parked it. Nevertheless the car still bumped into the tree. I cursed softly at its faulty brakes. The car was a legacy from my grandfather who had given up the ghost the year before. According to the legend, he had been gifted the car at the dawn of independence by his erstwhile girlfriend whose father had been a grumpy British settler for whom he worked as a cook. The teary girlfriend, beside herself with grief for being forbidden to marry her sweetheart and flying him back to England, had left him the car, against her father’s wishes, as a memento of their short-lived romantic dalliance.
                <br>
                <br>
                I pushed the rickety door open and stepped into the freezing morning air which cut like a razor into the skin. I slammed the door twice before it could shut properly. My teeth rattled in the cold. I thrust my hands deep into the pockets of my old duffel coat to warm my numb fingers. I walked stiffly in my mud boots towards the buildings before I was brought up short by shouts and screams. I broke into a run in the direction of the classrooms where the noise was coming from. I rounded a corner in a skid and found myself in the middle of a pandemonium. Pupils were engaged in all manner of antics. I ducked as a lump of mud came flying at me and landed on the wall behind me with a soft thud. A shrieking girl shot out of nowhere chased by another and ran smack into me almost knocking me over. I got hold of her and glared down at her muddy face. “Oh, sorry,” she mumbled and fled to the classroom in fear.
                <br>
                <br>
                Everybody disappeared into their classrooms like rabbits into their rabbit holes as soon as they spotted me. However I noticed a group of pupils huddled outside the door of their classroom casting wary glances at me. I stomped off towards them. “What’s going on here?” I growled when I came to them. Silence. “Cat got your tongue?” I said looking from one face to the other, “Why aren’t you in your classroom?” I barked at them making the more timid ones to jump in fright. “Excuse me, sir,” a thin fearful voice came from the back. “Yes!” I snapped. It was the class monitor, “The teacher’s table has been messed,” he said. “Messed? How?” I asked. He avoided my eyes. “Badly, sir.” He replied hesitantly.
                <br>
                <br>
                I narrowed my eyes at him as I cautiously approached the door, pushed it open and peered inside. “You won’t like it, sir,” he warned.  But it was too late. My eyes were met by the most obnoxious sight I had ever laid my eyes on. Someone had answered mother nature’s call on the table, right in the middle of it. Then he had gone on to do a poor caricature of me on the blackboard squatted, with my pants down, relieving myself on top of another table. He had scrawled next to it ‘Mr. Marangi, Master of Pooping’ I was knocked back by an odious stench that drifted from the table. I staggered outside gasping for fresh air. I stood there in a state of utter bewilderment, my mouth agape and unable to make sense of this ugly incident. I kept glancing at the door as if the smelly pile behind the door was a time bomb that could explode at any moment. I finally recovered my senses and saw to the cleaning of the mess. I briefed the shocked teachers about the horrible scene and most sympathised with me but a few could hardly keep a straight face. Much later in the day, as I patrolled the school grounds, I had in mind one boy who was capable of pulling such a dirty stunt and he was walking towards me in the opposite direction, right at that moment, along a pavement lined on both sides with colourful bougainvillea bushes. His name was Jack. He was a short mean-faced boy from grade 8. We had had several run-ins with him in the past and the most recent one was during the annual prize-giving day a few weeks earlier. Everybody had been seated at the school lawn. It was a beautiful day and not a cloud could be seen anywhere in the wide blue sky. There had been a downpour the previous night and a lovely smell of wet earth pervaded the air. The teachers trooped in one by one taking their seats in front of the gathering. Mrs. Muchiri came in last to find all the seats taken. Being the nearest person she could send, she beckoned to Jack and whispered some words to him. He dashed off towards the staffroom and walked back with another chair which he proceeded to set down neatly for Mrs. Muchiri. She thanked him and Jack bowed theatrically before her causing a slight ripple of laughter to run through the crowd. The rascal!
                <br>
                <br>
                Mrs. Muchiri, a heavyset woman, was in the act of smoothing her wide prim skirt with one hand while the other pulled the chair close so she could sit when I suddenly realised with horror that the chair had a broken leg. “No, don’t!” I shouted a warning as I half-rose to stop the inevitable, rather too late as it turned out, for as she got hold of the back of the chair, in one fluid movement, she lowered her enormous backside into the doomed chair. A collective gasp rose from the crowd as people learnt with shock what was about to happen. With a loud splintering noise the chair gave way under her immense weight and she crashed to the ground with a force that shook the whole ground.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pupils, never ones to miss a hilarious moment, roared with laughter. I moved with lightning speed to pull her to her feet. She grabbed my extended hand and pulled. But she was a little too heavy for me and I yielded under her weight. I flailed my arms like a windmill to keep from falling but it was an exercise in futility as I landed on top of her with my chin buried in her massive bosom. The laughter rose to a deafening crescendo. “Oops! Sorry!” was all I could manage to utter as I rolled away from her in embarrassment. She turned over slowly and painfully came to her feet. She excused herself and limped away to the staffroom in the company of two lady teachers. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The noise had gradually died down and a semblance of order returned as the ceremony went on without another incident. I searched the crowd for Jack and I spotted him at the back with his face set in a serious expression even as laughter contorted the faces of his friends around him. Later I summoned him to my discipline master’s office and questioned him about it but he roundly protested his innocence. Still, I was not going to let him get away with it.  I handed him a hoe and sent him away to dig on a wild patch of land that was overgrown with bushes in the farthest reaches of the school compound as punishment. He gave me a hostile look and left with an angry click of the tongue.
                <br>
                <br>
                There he was now walking up the path nonchalantly, hands in the pocket of his shorts with an impish grin on his face. He had not seen me yet and then he looked up. A startled look came over his face and he hesitated for a brief moment before walking on as I stood in the middle of the path. “I will get you one way or another,” I growled at him as he brushed past. The boy just snorted at me and walked away pompously. I stood there looking after the little receding figure in impotent anger.
                <br>
                <br>
                Things returned to normalcy except that I was now drawing funny stares wherever I went. One day I was passing a group of chattering women at the shopping centre when they suddenly went mute when they saw me. As soon as I walked past they were bent double in laughter. I shot them a withering look and went about my business. On Sunday, in the little church nestled in a wooded glen, the congregation listened in mild amusement as the priest delivered a fiery sermon about the vice of making mockery of ‘our teachers’. I felt the stare of a hundred eyes on me. I shifted nervously in my seat in discomfort at being the focus of attention. I tried hard to concentrate my gaze on the preacher who was now foaming at the corners of his mouth from the exerted effort of expostulation. I broke into a sweat and cleared my throat once or twice as I willed the church service to come to a quick end. In a thunderous voice that resonated through the packed church he suddenly launched into a lengthy feverish prayer to the ethereal powers ‘to forgive them for they know not what they do. For though their sins be as scarlet they will be washed as white as snow.’ A drawn-out ‘Amen’ at the end of the prayer brought the service to an abrupt end. “Thank you Jesus,” I said inwardly with gratitude. However, I was perturbed to find that someone had traced with a finger the words, ‘Mr. Poop’ on the dusty surface of the rear windscreen of my car outside the church. I got an old rag and dusted them off before driving off in an agitated mood.

                Very soon it was the end of the term and preparations for the end of the year school closing ceremony the following day were in top gear. Everybody, as expected, was in a festive mood in anticipation of the holiday ahead. The headmaster sent me on an errand in town to pick some school supplies and other items that would be needed the next day. “Get a few boys to accompany you as there is some heavy stuff there,” he told me. A group of four boys from grade eight, with Jack among them happened to be passing by as I came out of the office. Here was a wonderful chance to spite the little devil, I thought. I called them over and went ahead to pick three of them while maliciously leaving out Jack in favour of another boy who was just arriving. “Get into the car,” I said, “we are going for a ride in town.”  The overly excited boys thanked me and shouted in joy as they raced each other to the car. A visit to town was every boy’s dream in these parts and they could hardly believe their luck. Jack watched in dismay as his friends piled into the car one after the other. He looked at me pleadingly. “I’m sorry Jack,” I said sarcastically, “I hate to leave you behind but you might poop in my car and we can’t have that, can we?” And then I laughed uproariously. He scowled hard at me and walked away seething in anger. “Serves you right boy.” I said after him. If only I knew what was to follow I should have gone slow on him.

                The following day broke clear and sunny and there was a celebratory mood in the air. I drove into the compound and parked my old Datsun at its usual place. A humming noise sounded somewhere and I looked up. A large swarm of bees had built its hive on one of the overhanging branches, perilously close to the car. I stepped away cautiously lest I disturb them.  It was not uncommon to find a swarm of bees there taking a rest in their long flight to a more hospitable environment so I was not unduly worried. I walked to the school lawn to find that teachers had already seen to the putting up of the guests’ tent and laying out of the chairs and desks. I assisted in setting up the public address system. An hour or so later the invited guests and parents started arriving to the accompaniment of gospel music that blared out of the speakers. I was the designated master of ceremonies. At around noon everybody was assembled and I took the mike to announce the start of the ceremony.

                <br>
                Things were moving on well when somebody passed me a note with a message that I had a visitor waiting by my car. I had not been expecting any visitor and I was a little puzzled. However I excused myself and walked to the car. There was nobody in view. I stood there perplexed. A stirring in the adjacent bushes made me turn that way as a little masked figure popped out and took a shot at me with a slingshot. I screamed in alarm as the missile flew above my head and struck at the overhanging branch which snapped and fell on the car’s bonnet with a dull thud. My eyes widened in terror as the wild buzzing of the furious bees came to my ears. I raced down the field, with the enraged bees in hot pursuit, where a startled herd of cows that had been calmly munching away at the lush grass stopped to watch me as I barrelled down towards them, unaware of the danger that lurked behind. I overtook them as they galloped away in fright into the outlying maize field where we all took cover from the ferocious bees. A while later I emerged from the maize field and charged up the hill to where the meeting was still going on unaware of my latest tribulations. I must have looked a sight in my muddied clothes and dishevelled hair. My face was so grotesquely swollen people started when they saw me.

                <br>
                I walked up to the school inspector who had been addressing the gathering before she stopped to stare at me wide-eyed. I grabbed the mike from her, “Jack Mugo!” I yelled down the mike, “I’m going to kill you, idiot!” I dropped the mike which struck the ground with a loud amplified thump. I rushed into the crowd as I vaulted over chairs and desks. “Stop him! He has gone mad!” someone exclaimed. And then a little figure shot out of the crowd towards the school gate. I gave chase but someone tripped me and I tumbled in the grass where a dozen hands held me down as I screamed in frustration. I ran out of steam eventually and calmed down. I was taken to the local dispensary mumbling to myself and the doctor prescribed medicinal oil for the bee stings and some sedatives to calm my frayed nerves.

                Months later after this episode, I was seated a hundred miles away in a tiny mud-walled hut that leaned dangerously to one side with a sign above a creaky door that read ‘headmaster’s office’. The said headmaster was now studying my posting letter with a slight frown. He was a tall lanky bespectacled fellow. He shook his white-haired head slowly and looked up at me with keen interest. “I don’t want to sound intrusive but what made you leave such a good place and travel all the way to this godforsaken land?” he asked. I looked back at him for a while as I pondered his question. I was not about to tell a stranger about how my further interactions with a mere schoolboy could have led to my ruination, physically and mentally. “Teaching is a noble profession,” I told him philosophically “and somebody got to educate these folks anyway.” It was true in a sense but what really mattered was that I was very far away from that little scoundrel Jack and his diabolic schemes. He smiled at me as a boy came in and handed him a sheaf of papers. “Taabu,” he said to the boy, “show Mr. Marangi to your class. He will be your new Mathematics teacher.” The boy turned to look at me. I sat transfixed in my chair as I stared back in dread at the face of Jack. How was it possible? “But this is Jack from my former school,” I wailed pointing a shaking finger at him. Both looked at me in puzzlement. “No, this is Taabu,” the man informed me, “and he has been with us from the beginning.” I remained there like somebody hypnotised looking at the boy. “Excuse me, sir,” the boy said after a while, “this way.” I followed the boy in a daze, out in the scorching sun with an overwhelming sense of impending doom.

                In the distance, a thin column of whirlwind was fast making its way across the dusty plain towards us. Before I knew it I was enveloped in a suffocating blanket of dust and debris. I stumbled and fell as I ran blindly. I screamed in panic as a screeching noise like that of a thousand demons pounded my ears as billions of dust particles bombarded me and tried to force their way into my body through the mouth, ears and eyes. And then it was gone, as sudden as it had come. The boy stood there with an amused look staring down at my dishevelled figure as I lay there spread-eagled in the dust. I stared back in amazement. Not a hair out of place, his immaculate green uniform remained intact while his polished black shoes still gleamed in the blazing sun. He waited patiently as I struggled to my feet before resuming his assigned task of showing me to class. I felt like a condemned man walking to face his executioner. </h4>

                <h4>Tonight, a song grows from the tip of my tongue.
                    <br>
                    Sweet like an aubade on the heartstrings of new lovers. 
                    <br>
                    It says, Child, surely, morning comes. Tell this night, morning comes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And now, an unusual night hovers. 
                    <br>
                    Not the kind that carries the calligraphy of the moon 
                    <br>
                    like an epitaph to a dead day.
                    <br>
                    The same song wells in me now, I crave for it like an addict's weed. 
                    <br>
                    In my bowels. On my lips. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What frightens me about this night is not that it eclipses the sun. It is not 
                    <br>
                    that the orange moon claims the sky— 
                    <br>
                    An ember of light that reminds of a wilting hibiscus, 
                    <br>
                    withering yam tendrils, of drought, dying & death. 
                    <br>
                    It is not the darkness. Not the starkness.
                    <br>
                    It is about this silence & the echoes of my nightly lyrics: 
                    <br>
                    Child, surely, morning comes. Tell this night, morning comes. 
                    <br>
                    It is about this nakedness. This  vulnerability.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, when the night clocks into its darkest hour. I become a prairie of tongues. 
                    <br>
                    A song lights my spirit. A song settles on my soul. 
                    <br>
                    Like an anthem, my body crouches in the awe of its lines. 
                    <br>
                    & my palate finds a paean of peace for my piercing pains: 
                    <br>
                    Child, surely, morning comes. Tell this night, morning comes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This nightly song creates a pool of memories, like vaccines, in my soul. 
                    <br>
                    So strong & sleek the night slips into me again to the wake of a 
                    <br>
                    whirlpool of warship. Of a song incense with prayer. 
                    <br>
                    This song rises like a waft of smoke, like a phoenix. 
                    <br>
                    It matches the night & its hordes of entourage. 
                    <br>
                    Wits for wiles. & wits for wiles. 
                    <br>
                    It matches the night and its hordes of entourage. 
                    <br>
                    & the night begins to retract, begins to retreat, begins to recede 
                    <br>
                    into a morning; crisp & azure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h4>My mama always tell me say I go make good wife for the man whey go marry me. I believe her. My mama never tell me lie. I be first daughter and second child. My papa too tell me say he will marry me to fine man. I start to hear all this marriage talk when I be only ten years. I don't know that marriage will be something near to me like this because people I know use to marry when they have big. Big big girls like my cousin, Ese and my cousin, Doro marry when they have reach like after twenty years. It hard me when my papa now say I will marry the next year. Ordinary eleven years. I cry. I cry plenty cry. My mama say I make me no worry. She say the man love me and take care of me. I no want. But my choice no plenty like that. E small like beggar own. If I say no, I will not have where to go to because I will have to run away from my papa house. And I will be disgracing my papa name. So, I agree, not that I have plenty choice to choose but I agree. I agree to marry the man that is like the same age of my papa.

                        <br>
                        I have now reach eleven years. I hear my mama and my papa talk one night. I stand outside their door for room. That time, it is already near the time that the man  marry me will come carry me to him house. My papa is telling my mama that he cannot take back him promise to him friend. He is asking my mama that have she forget the time him friend give him plenty money to help my mama in the hospital? It was the time my mama sick and doctor say they have to remove something from inside her body by operation. My mama start to cry. She start to cry that her child now have to pay for what happen years before she born me. I start to cry too. Small small so them no hear me. My papa is giving me to man in marriage to pay for money that he is owing. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I walk from the door before any of them come out of the room. I go to my room and I continue to cry. I am not understanding anything. I am too small to marry. I will now carry belle for man that is my papa age. How will my small waist carry the belle? I am fearing. I am fearing what will happen after I marry the man. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I remember one story that my mama use to tell us—me and my brother and sisters. I have two small sisters. I am praying that my papa will not use them to do debt payment too like he want to use me.  My mama use to tell us the story and in the story, the girl parents always use to protect her. They never want bad thing to come near her. My mama always tell us the story to make us know that she and my papa will always take care of us. So now that my papa want to give me to man to clear him debt, I want to still believe that he will always take care of me. I want to believe that he will always protect me and that he is not giving me to the man because he do not like me again like him daughter. My papa be good man. Very good man. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In our community, everybody love my papa. They say he always do things right. They say he show good example of true husband and true father. If my papa who is good example of true husband and true father is giving small me to man to marry, at eleven years, then he is doing it because he know it is good thing to do for our family. I believe my papa is still a good papa. I don’t want to vex for him for what he want to do. If not that my mama sick, my papa for no make that kind of promise to the man say him go give me, him first daughter, to him for wife to pay back the money that he give my papa to save my mama life. It only show that my papa is really good man. So, I will not too fear again. The man that will marry me will take care of me well because he be my papa friend from the thing I hear them talk the other night. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My first small sister walk into the room. I clean my face quick quick. I don’t want her to ask me plenty question why I am crying. She already see that I am crying before I clean my face and so she ask me, 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Sista Jiro, why you dey cry?”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “I no dey cry. Something enter inside my eye, that is why it red,” I answer. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        She look me well. She know I lie but she don’t say anything. She sit down on the bed. I look at her. She look at me. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Mama tell me say you go soon go your husband house,” she say, tying her fingers together. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I don’t know that my mama have tell my sister about the marriage. I nod head. She come and hug me. As she finish hugging me, she start to clean my face. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Don’t cry again, Sista. Mama say the man will do you good.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I smile for her. Weak smile. I like my small sister very well. She is good girl. She know how to take care of person and love the person. She always talk to me and she always like to play with me. My other small sister have not big. She is still like three years. This one is eight years. She know small thing about life. As she talk to me now, my heart feel small relief. I feel like the marriage will now be easy because I know that my sister will always love me. And my mama too. And even my papa too. My brother have travel to the big city of Warri since he become fifteen years. He stay with my papa brother doing apprentice boy for him shop. He don't know that I will soon marry and I know my papa have not tell him through phone or letter. I wish my brother is here so I can tell him about the money marriage my papa want to put me inside. I too small to marry that man. Everybody know but nobody want do anything for me. My papa have make promise since before my mama born me to the man so he cannot say he will not give me to him again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My small sister soon tell me she is going to watch my mama cook in the kitchen so she can learn cooking too. I nod and she walk away. 
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        My cry have start to reduce small small as the day of marriage near. My mama have go market to buy fine cloth for me. Sometimes I am thinking of running away but I cannot disgrace my papa and put him inside debt. I cannot run away and allow the man come and carry my small sisters. So, I stay. I stay and I tell my mama that I like the cloth. I lie. I do not have strength to like the cloth because my whole mind is disturbing me like when flies are flying round-round your head. My mama know I no happy but she smile and carry the cloth away. She say she will keep it in her ekpeti, that her suitcase that she put everything she like. I watch her leave my room and I feel the cry coming so I slap my face small and sniff and sniff until the cry go back inside. I will soon be married woman, I cannot be crying anyhow again. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        *
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The man is not coming to carry me, they tell me. It is my papa and him people that will carry me to the man house as he have already paid for me. My mama and her sister and friends will dress me and follow me go him house. There, I will now do everything the man want me to do for him. Things like born him children, sweep him house, cook for him, wash him plate. Those kind things.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My mama call her friends. Many of them are our neighbor, like Mama Kobele and Mama Eight o’clock. The name always make me laugh. I always wonder why she name her child name that is time. The women come to help me dress up for my new husband. I have not even see the man before. I only know he old like my papa. Around fifty years. He have two wife already but he is still marry me as third wife. All this thing my mama tell me before today. I think whether he will marry another wife after me or if I will now be last wife. I hear the man other wife them have children. Some of the children are my age; the other ones are senior enough to marry me. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My Papa have say it will be alright but he have also say after I marry, he will not take care of me again. He say I will learn to take care of myself. That is what wife do, he tell me. I nod my head for my papa but I really don’t understand why he talk like he want to abandon me. If my papa want to abandon me, then my mama will not abandon me. That is what I tell myself. My mama cannot leave her daughter to be unhappy. She have always promise me happiness and I believe her. She will give me happiness.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The women tie my igele for me. That is after they have tie my wrapper for me. I look like my mama. Like the way she look inside her wedding picture with my papa. The women have ready me. I do not protest. They are now praising me saying that I am omo oyibo, fine child. They are saying that I will make good wife. They are now singing the native wedding escort song for me. I am not vexing again like the first time they tell me I will marry old man. I am not even worrying again. It have happen, it have happen. Whiteman will say don’t cry over spill milk. I will not cry over this spill milk. It have already spill. My mama and the women follow me to the man house. When we reach there, the wife welcome me. The man come to meet me. It is the first time I am seeing him. The man is not fine in the face. He is very big, bigger than my papa. He is not fat as I used to picture him in my head but he have big tummy, tummy bigger than my papa own. I am imagining the tummy sitting on top of me. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I kneel down and greet him. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Stand up, my wife,” he tell me smiling. “Welcome, my small wife.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The man is looking so happy like he have not see new wife before. See how he is smiling anyhow. Let me stop saying the man. He is now my husband. I wonder why he is smiling the way he is smiling. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The senior wife them follow me to my room after I say bye bye to my mama and the women. The very senior wife tell me that is me that will stay with the man in him room that night since it is our wedding night. It don’t feel like the wedding I see in the films we watch. There is always big party and love in those ones. I sit down on the bed and the senior wife leave. I remove the igele but I do not remove my clothes because I do not know what the man—my husband—would like me to do.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        I am already sleeping when the senior wife wake me and say in a soft sweet voice,
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Our wife, our husband is calling you.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I struggle to clean my eye with the back of my hand. I yawn very wide yawn. I wear my slippers and follow the senior wife as she carry me to our husband room. She knock on his door and leave me there. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Enter!” our husband shout from inside. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “My fine wife,” he praise me when I enter.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I say nothing. I only bend my head.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “Sit”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My husband say I should sit down on the bed by him. I do so. He look at me and ask me if I have already seen my blood. I do not understand what he is saying but I nod my head still because I know I have seen month flow and maybe that is what he is calling my blood. He say my breasts are so small but he laugh and say soon they will be very big. He say he will take care of me well. My husband now say I should remove my clothes. I am crying and removing my clothes one by one. My husband have wide smile on him face. He tell me to lie down. I lie down. I am crying well well now. He don’t listen to my cry as he pull him clothes. I am looking at him big tummy. He is laughing and calling me fine fine names. He remove him trouser. I see him man thing. I have see man thing before but only my brother own and my friend Karo own when we used to play small children play. This my husband man thing is very big. I have not see this type before.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He climb the bed and put one finger over him mouth. “Be quiet!”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I start to cry more. He hold my two hand down. I am shouting my mama name. I know senior wife can hear but she do not come to the door. My husband start to do me like he is pounding yam. It is paining me. I am fearing as he is doing the thing to me. My woman thing is paining me. My waist is paining me. Everywhere is paining me. Nobody tell me about this. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My husband finally finish what he is doing to me and fall to the other side of the bed. He start to snore. I come down from the bed and wrap myself with wrapper on the floor. I am crying small small. All my body is shaking. Plenty blood is between my two leg, on the bed and on the floor where I sit. My husband snore is very loud. I want to die. My papa and my mama have put me inside bondage. My body is on fire.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        *
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the morning, my husband wake up to see me on the floor. He wake me up and tell me to go to my room. He say senior wife will show me round the house and tell me what to do. Yesterday night terrible something for me. I am imagine how many more of that night I can manage. Why will my papa do me like this? Why will he use me, him daughter, to do borrow borrow. Now, I am somebody money wife. He can do me anyhow he want. I just want to die. This whole house is very bad for me and I have already tire. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I start to think big thinking. I cannot continue to stay inside this my husband house. I cannot go back to my papa house. I will run. I will run far. The man have marry me and cannot carry my small sister again. So I will run. I do not know which day I will run but I know I will run because I cannot continue inside this torture.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But running now hard. The house is not easy to leave. So I remain there. I remain there receiving all the punishment from that man in the name of marriage. I don’t even feel like eleven years child again. I am now person wife. So, when it start to tire me, I say I cannot do again. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then, I carry belle. It is senior wife that find out. I start to sick well well. As I carry belle, my husband send me to my papa house so I can born the child there. I happy well well. But he don’t even give support money. My mama tell me that is what they do to wife like me—wife that they use to pay debt. She say the man have pay for everything with the money he borrow papa. Small eleven years like me carry big belle. I promise myself that I will run and leave the baby for them after I born it. My small sisters will be using my belle to play before they go school and after they come back. I have stop school even before this marriage talk start and as marriage come, no hope for school again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The baby soon come. It is a girl. I call her Emuakpo because there are plenty things in this life. Plenty things like the thing I am suffering. The second night after the morning that I born Emuakpo, I run away. I don’t know where I am running to, but I run away fast fast as my leg can run. I do not look back. I just continue to run and I am crying as I am running. I have leave Emuakpo for my husband, I think a child is enough to pay all the debt that my papa is owing him. <br>

            <h4>All thirty-three passengers on the bus were strangely quiet, no one talked about how hot the weather was or the recent increase in the fuel price, no one even talked about the new virus that was spreading fast.  As strange as it may seem, the children too were numb, except the two-year-old girl, who sat on her mother's feet and munched groundnut. She would sometimes tilt her head to the side every two to three minutes and make eye contact with Dauda. This whole situation did not only make Dauda readjust on the floor uncomfortably, but it also made him hold his mouth together and swallow his own spit, he did not have breakfast before leaving the house. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After about three and a half hours into the trip, the quietness on the bus became a problem for Dauda. It made the journey seem extremely long, coupled with the fact that he was seated at the feet of a man he would later know as Alhaji. On that sunny Tuesday afternoon in June,  Dauda sat inside a rusty bus as it made its way through the desert. Inside it, with him, were men, women, and other children, all artfully arranged. The men to the left, the women to the right, and the children on the floor. The green bus looked haggard, and frequently made quirky sounds as a subtle way of protesting, probably because it was tired of making the same journey over and over again.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alhaji kept thrusting his snow coloured tasbih, occasionally he would pause to adjust his legs, and this irritated Dauda greatly, he hissed and grumbled under his breath each time Alhaji’s legs hit his hands. What infuriated Dauda the most was the fact that he had to sit between Alhaji's legs and breathe in the smell of his buttocks. It was not a pleasant smell. As they journeyed, Dauda attempted to sing in his mind as a conscious effort to forget, an attempt to not remember Alhaji and a deliberate attempt to ignore the fact that he was running away from Kano, from his master; Mallam Danko. Everything in his life was going well until yesterday when he heard Fatimah, the short woman with a loud mouth who sold kerosene at the back of the mosque, discuss with her friend. He heard her say: "You see this boy wey dem dey call Dauda, his parents’ dey Mali, and he dey suffer here for Kano, he dey beg for money." He pretended not to hear and focused on the rich man in purple kaftan he was begging for alms from, but he knew what he would do, he would journey to Mali to find his parents.
                <br>
                <br>
                The next morning, he made sure he woke up before the other boys, carefully found his way out of the hut while the other boys lay scattered on the bare floor sleeping, placed his Ankara on his unwashed body, and tiptoed out of the hut. The torn Ankara he wore was the only piece of clothing he owned and with the many tears and holes in it, it could easily pass as a rag to another boy of his age. He left the hut quietly and made his way into this shabby bus. Before he boarded, no one in the motor park asked him why he was going to Mali, no one even asked why he was travelling alone, in fact, he wasn't used to people pausing to ask him questions, he was used to people stopping to chase him away. On his way to the motor park, he prayed a silent prayer in his mind for no one to chase him, and thankfully, no one did. So now, his only regret was the fact that he had to sit between the foul-smelling legs of Alhaji. He could not complain, the bus was free for children, especially children with frail figures like him. 
                <br>
                <br>
                He sat on the floor, in between Alhaji's legs determined, he had had enough, he had spent eleven years of his life eating people’s leftovers at restaurants,  roaming the streets, begging for alms, and handing over all his proceeds to Malam Danko every night. Mallam Danko was the only father figure he knew. Oftentimes he wished Mallam Danko was another person because the way the Mallam’s legs banged the floor whenever he walked into the room left a sharp pain in Dauda’s throat, his brown moustache which no one ever dared to look at made Dauda shiver, and the whip he tossed left and right with his hands every time he addressed the boys gave him sleepless nights. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Truth be told, Mallam Danko could whip anyone to stupor, especially the boys who used the money inside their begging bowls to buy food for themselves without informing the Mallam. Mallam Danko would hit them till blood gushed out of their back, Dauda’s heart raced each time he watched, and Mallam Danko made him watch, he made all the boys watch. Dauda detested the sight of blood, it irritated him and it made him feel like throwing up, but he dared not complain. So he decided he would be content, he would be fine with leftovers at restaurants, he wouldn't want to cross the line with the Mallam, but everything changed the day he heard Fathima speak about his parents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Honestly, the day he heard Fatimah and her friend's conversation was the happiest day of his life, that same day, he also heard that his parents used him as collateral for the debt they owed the Mallam. This made him more determined to endure the moist below of Alhaji, who kept bringing phlegm out of his mouth every second. He would endure because it was nothing compared to living with Mallam Danko. He began to sing a song softly. The song the children in the street sang whenever they saw him and the other boys begging. He sang the song as a means to escape:
                <br>
                <br>
                "ka ga wannan yaron, 
                <br>
                babu makaranta, 
                <br>
                yana rokon abinci, 
                <br>
                ka ga rigar da ta ƙazanta, 
                <br>
                bai da takalmi, 
                <br>
                ka ga wannan yaron da datti"
                <br>
                He sang slowly and quietly, and the song helped, because, in those few minutes, he forgot about Alhaji’s smelling buttocks and the mystery of his life.
                <br>
                <br>
                He was enjoying the escape the song brought, when the bus abruptly hit a stone and everyone including Dauda came back to consciousness. The bus was disorganised for a few minutes as the passengers screamed at the driver: "can't you see?", "Why you dey drive like drunk man?", “wannan direban mahaukaci ne”, "I have marked this man's face, never again will I enter his bus", “mu dai kawai muyi addu'a Allah ya kiyaye lafiya". So many words were flying around, especially from the women. The driver pretended not to hear them and he went on swinging his head, humming to the song playing on the radio. After a series of talk here and there, and no response from the driver, the women retired back to their silence, and Dauda became bored again.
                <br>
                <br>
                He decided to play a trick on anyone who made eye contact with him, he would look them in the eye without blinking. His main target was the two-year-old girl nibbling groundnut. He promised himself he would yell “mahaukaci” if the girl made eye contact with him again, but no one looked him in the eye, not even the girl. Then, in the flash of a moment, something on Alhaji's feet pulled his attention, it was a thousand naira note, it lay there crumpled and abandoned. By the time Dauda saw it, Alhaji’s legs were dangerously close to the note, he was about to step on it. Dauda had never held a thousand naira note in his life. He tried to look away, but he just could not. After about ten minutes, he stretched his legs in a way to suggest he was tired and needed a good stretch, he reached for the money, grabbed it swiftly and adjusted. He thought about how clever he was, and this brought a grin to his face. He began to think about what he would do with the money, he wondered how big a thousand naira is. Will he be able to buy a car? A house? Or just food?
                <br>
                <br>
                He was brought back to consciousness by the screams in the bus. At first, it didn't make sense to him, but as he became more conscious, he knew they were screams of "thief!" thief!" barawo!" “barawo!”.  He pondered on how a thief could be inside the bus, with the way everyone's face looked so innocent. Then came a loud bang on his head, the bus had stopped. "As you small reach, you dey thief money" came the words of a man in his mid-twenties who wore haggard jeans and a dirty shirt that read "no pain no gain". His lips were black, he had removed his cap due to the heat in the bus and he held it in his hands. Dauda remembered the one thousand naira, did they see him? Did they know? He fell on the floor and started to cry and beg, but it all went into deaf ears. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Now everyone had alighted from the bus. The women still separate from the men and the children in a corner, squinted their eyes due to the harshness of the desert sun. "My boy, why you thief my money?" asked Alhaji. Until then, Dauda did not even know the money belonged to Alhaji.  “Sorry sir" "Sorry sir" he began to say with his head down, his face soaked in tears. He was not trained to lie, he was not even trained to steal. Begging was okay if it was given willingly. He thought of Mallam Danko and what he would think of the situation he had gotten himself into. Mallam Danko would be so furious. He would beat him until blood came out from his back as he did to those boys, he would be disappointed. What about his parents whom he had never met? What would they make of it if they find out that he stole on his way to meet them? It was the first time he had ever taken what wasn't his, all he could do was plead and beg, but no one was having any of that.
                <br>
                <br>
                The bus driver gradually moved close to Dauda, he pulled him up and placed his hand on his shoulder to stroke him. This act made Dauda freeze, because, before that time, no one had ever touched him. Not even the Mallam or his fellow Almajiri boys. The driver's stroke was not only strange but uncomfortable, because he wore a straight face. A face that was not in any way sympathetic. After a few taps, the driver started to speak: "boy, you know how it is, stealing is bad, it is haram, you can't ride with us again" the driver said while adjusting his belt buckle, he talked without any sign of sympathy. Upon hearing this, Dauda tossed himself on the ground again and began to cry, he started to plead: "Where I go go?" "Only sand dey this place" ”Yi hakuri”
                <br>
                <br>
                Truth be told, the closest thing was the white sand on the ground. If they left him, he would wander aimlessly in the desert. He pressed a little further: "How I go reach house?" "What about my mama and papa wey I dey find?" He rolled his frail body on the floor pleading. Dauda brought out the naira note and pleaded with Alhaji to take back his money. "Better stand up boy, not only would we leave you here, we would have to cut your left thumb," said a lanky man in a neatly pressed grey suit in the background. This made Dauda wail even more. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Upon hearing this, Alhaji began to beg on behalf of Dauda, he pleaded that Dauda would not do it anymore, his face near to tears, he held Dauda's hands in solidarity, but it all went to deaf ears. Only a few minutes after, a machete the driver pulled out from under his seat penetrated Dauda’s left thumb. His scream was so loud it could wake the bodies in the cemetery. Alhaji upon looking at the driver’s blood-stained hands, the remorseless faces of the people in the background, knew it was the end of the journey for him. He could not leave Dauda alone. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Alhaji promised to take Dauda home, “from today, you don be my son, I go carry you go school.'' he said. Dauda did not even have enough strength to argue, he just stared at Alhaji blanky. He was looking for his parents anyway, and he found one at the lowest point in his life.</h4>

            <h4> I always thought that being a creative will feel like being in La La land, actually, I didn’t just think, I knew it because I started my career in some fantasy world. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I was maybe eight when I realized that I loved telling stories, I would go to the backyard and with small sticks, as characters, I would act out my stories; digging holes as I moved the sticks around to school, parties, visitations and what not. Those brittle sticks did everything – they travelled the world, met the Queen, became Presidents and Prime Ministers, until my dad zapped me back to reality; like a bad movie.
                <br>
                <br>
                My dad was going through a financial crisis at the time and boy did he think everything was diabolical; a bird would cry and he would spring right into prayers; don’t cough at odd hours of the day, that could be bad luck, virtually everything and everyone was a suspect and we weren't left out. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When my dad saw those holes in the ground, he said they brought bad luck. He made it clear that he didn't want to see them again and he didn't have a budget for the many problems and health hazards that came with playing with sticks. I wondered for days what those could have been, perhaps if I accidentally swallowed a stick? But that was the end of my first fantasy world, I said goodbye to Hannah, Joey, Chinwe, and as many stick characters as I could. High school was over before it began, but I was not deterred.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a child, I spent most of my time by myself, and I guess that’s why I fell in love with storytelling. I imagined a different world than I existed in and lived in my mind half the time – it was pure fantasy, but it was better than reality. When I could no longer play out the stories in my head with my sticks, I sought other means to bring my characters to life, and then came the magical duo; the pen and paper – Oh the wonder! I could write! I could write all my thoughts out and read them over again, I could create my universe and make a potato the president if I wished, I could do anything!
                <br>
                <br>
                And so it began, that I started creating paper fantasies, reading them over and over again. I was the lead character in all my stories, and I lived out all my fantasies! Like those brittle sticks, I did everything I ever wished I could do but couldn’t; I travelled the world, got married to a prince, came top in my class (well, I always did this in real life 😊), you know, virtually everything! 
                <br>
                <br>
                But that was when I was eight and it’s been a while now.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a teenager, I wasn’t any different from my peers. I grew up like every other teenager, I was no longer obsessed with my fantasies (obviously), I still wrote from time to time but I had a new obsession and it was with motion picture. Every time I watched a movie that stood out for me, I would pause to think of the ‘how’, I was genuinely fanatical; I would watch screen credits roll to the end, I would listen to every word, every beat, watch every action – I maxed out my debit card and paid attention in full!.
                <br>
                <br>
                By sixteen, I had started writing screenplays, the plotlines weren’t well thought out, the format was wrong, they all needed fixing, but I had something way better than all those errors – Passion and a Story; and I was determined to tell it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                All through my University days, I worked as a freelance scriptwriter earning peanuts and ‘exposure’ for my writing. I was also unfortunate because I met a lot of lunatics who took advantage of me; some stole my work, never giving me credit or money; some paid half the fee and absconded with the finished screenplay; some took my treatments and produced three parts! Three parts of a movie! Three! (I’m yelling in my Nigerian voice), and some paid in full but never produced my work (the audacity!). I think there’s a lot that young creatives do not know about getting into the creative industry, I also think that there are lots of stories that haven’t been told by these naive young creatives. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For someone who spent ALL her University days working hard, through sleepless nights, trying to finish off projects after projects, I am happy to announce that I graduated from the University without a penny to my name; okay, maybe I did have a little over a penny? What’s the exchange rate? But I was hopeful, ready for the future, I felt like my worse days were behind me, like graduating Uni was all I needed to start that bright future, the World will go blind when I walk into a room, I will be cashing out – did I hear ‘Ka-Ching’? 
                <br>
                <br>
                And then, just like my Dad did when I was eight, the world zapped me back to reality; like a bad movie.
                <br>
                <br>
                Life after Uni was nothing like I anticipated. If anyone was going blind, it was me! From malnutrition and staring long hours at my screen for even shittier pay. Writers were like vultures, everyone fought for the bottom of food chain pay, we all earned so little and worked so hard; it was dishonourable, to say the least! Producers had options, a fleece of poor and hungry writers waiting for one to say no, so they could say yes. Did one have an option you may ask? Yes! Say yes or starve – it was pretty straight forward.
                <br>
                <br>
                There were those writers so earned good money for their work, they were way high up on the food chain. We sat at their masterclasses and listened to them talk about being honourable with their craft and learning to say ‘no’, we were all so inspired when they bragged about how much they earned on their last job and the calibre of people they worked with. Was that it? I would always think to myself, is that what they all had in common? Working for the big guys? But of course, that wasn’t all they had in common, they all had the same sound of laughter; slightly condescending and almost laced with contempt. Or maybe it was me, maybe I felt so small around them, maybe I felt it was easier said than done, maybe I was envious, angry and still in awe all at once. Maybe I was silly.
                <br>
                <br>
                I always left those masterclasses thinking about what could be. I spent days and night daydreaming about my big break; I wrote multiple speeches before the mirror, I walked down several aisles to get my award plaque, and best of all, I got paid in six zeros - did I mention I was daydreaming? I spent the little hours left of my daydreaming days stalking those facilitators - the big shots. I bombarded them with emails and pilots and treatments and synopsis and loglines until the silent voice of rejection and shame begged me to stop. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Stop. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Write as a full-time lifer miserable was – Life as a full-time Writer was miserable. Some had it good, I wasn’t some, I was others and others had it, well, Bad!
                <br>
                <br>
                I was at the edge of misery about sinking into the bottomless ocean of nothingness, you know those ‘where did they go and whatever happened to them folks’? I was banging at their doors, begging to be let in! I knew I needed change. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I was tired of those masterclasses, I didn’t want to hear another word about honourable pay and saying no, I didn’t want to hear another word about the dignity of a creative or doing it for the Art, or exposure! Guess what? I couldn’t pay anyone with exposure, and I didn’t even have enough exposure to pay myself! Oh! I was sick of it! Of all the slangs, all the gatherings, all the lingos, of Final Draft, Celtx, Ms-Word; of prose, of screenplays, of articles; I was sick of everything that one could and couldn’t be sick of! I wanted a change and I wanted it two years back.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was then I knew and agreed that I needed the Creative’s worst nightmare; a job; no, not just any job, a 9 -5 job.

            <h4>  I watch from behind my seat as Mrs.Okogbuo goes on and again about the essence of X and Y and I wonder why people bother so much about innocent alphabets. Nonso kicks me from behind as an attempt to get me to sit up and act attentive before she picks me out and decides to ask questions to everybody around me. The sun is almost at its peak meaning that her class will end soon. Break-time comes immediately after her class. There was nothing too wonderful about this time, but I always longed to rush out of the class and place my head under the tap and let the water flow. Ikemefuna called it 'The Purification of Mathematical Nonsense' and I wonder where he had even learnt to use such high grammar. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Hey, you"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Me?" I touch my chest, quivering. Had she caught me while I was lost in thought? 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Don't you know yourself anuofia! Come on bilie!"
                <br>
                <br>
                Ikem stood up at the same time as me. We look at each other, then back to her wondering who she was actually referring to. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "You, not you anuofia, you, the one flying out... Yes... You... See me after class."
                <br>
                <br>
                I exhaled. I could swear my heart would have lept out if I had been the one she was referring to. 
                <br>

                <br>

                Community Secondary School, Nnewi had a huge compound with three long stretched bungalows, one for the senior section, one for the junior section and the last as the staffroom. Even the principal stayed in the staffroom. The school's field occupied the remaining space. I enjoyed spending my break time playing in the field. Whenever I was there everybody knew. You'd keep hearing 'The boy!!' here and there as I dribble my way to goals. I didn't know why, but to me playing football was like breathing. I never had to do much to excel. However, today I leant against the wall of the SS1 classroom and observed the girls playing kpukpukpoogene under the mango tree. A little away from them were some other girls muttering to themselves, laughing and playfully hitting one another. Probably one gossip or the other. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "The boy!!"
                <br>
                <br>
                "You wasted time oh." I say and turn to face Ikem who was coming towards me from the staffroom opposite the senior section. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Kedu na. Why Otigwogwo call you?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "The boy!" Smiling, he climbs up to join me. "Ka anyi rukene  field."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Udo odikwa?" 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Why not? Udo di." he continued, smiling.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Ikem, I'm serious." We were about approaching the field where boys from SS2 were playing against themselves. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "It's my father. They say he's been taken."
                <br>
                <br>
                "I don't understand. Who took him? Is the person mad?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "The boy... Onwugo. He's dead"
                <br>
                <br>
                I stopped walking immediately. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "The boy, ka anyi gabanu. Let's be going. Break time will soon be over."
                <br>
                <br>
                A lot of things ran through my mind at that instant, how Ikem was going to cope, the family drama he'd have to face, his sick mother, and how that could be the last time I might see him considering he might not be able to continue schooling.
                <br>
                <br>
                "...Ndo."
                <br>
                <br>
                "I'll knock you oh..Better don't change your face." he says playfully as he drags me towards the field. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                
                
                Nnewi to Ekwulobia by bus would take an hour but we had no intention of entering the bus. We had already used our transport fare to buy buns during break. Trekking back to Ekwulobia was something we were used to as we knew all the shortcuts to make the walk a three-hour something.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Emeka! Emeka! They'll be calling you Emeka now you won't answer. If it's 'The boy' now you'll start smiling anyhow. Nyem the ball biko." Ifeanyi hissed as he snatched the ball away from my grasp. I, Ikem, Ifeanyi and Nonso were used to taking the walk. Mr.Books taught us about Mandela's 'Long Walk to Freedom' and that automatically became our motto for our journey. We would take off our school uniforms, put on the jerseys that we had used to play during the break period. Then after tucking the uniforms into our bags, we would pass the ball to one another as we walked.

                "What later happened to Ikem, Daddy?" My eyes glow with curiosity as I stare into my father's face for answers. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Nwa a eh. You won't kill me." He laughs.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Ikem finished SS3 with us. He wrote the WAEC and NECO. He's also a big man today. Oya, time to sleep. It's late." He tucks me into bed, then roughly rubbing my head with his palm before covering me with the wrapper he said was his favourite wrapper when he was young. I hug myself tightly around the wrapper wondering if I can become Father. If I can be 'The boy.' My imaginations do not leave me even when I fall asleep.

                Emeka stands at the door and watches his son who was now snoring. He knew the boy was feeling sleepy but had just wanted him to complete the story. Complete... He had completed the story or had he? He wonders if he should have just told him that some stories are like the moon, they're never full or complete. He gently closes the door as he walks to his room. Complete... His mind drifts back again.

                I walk out of the class sweating. Teaching these children from the village Integrated Science and Mathematics is never easy. Somebody would always ask you why this was that and for every answer you gave, he had another 'why' to drop and a series of 'whys' for other answers to follow, but I needed the money to save up for my going to the higher institution. I couldn't keep depending on my parents as I had six other siblings that still needed to go to secondary school. There wasn't enough to fit everybody in at once. We went to secondary school one after the other, when one person was done with Class Five, our SS3 then, the other would enter and the elder one would start to fend for himself. Ikem, like Ifeanyi and Nonso had joined us to teach at Comprehensive College, Ekwulobia. His was not to further his education but to aid his ailing mother as he was the only child. It was past ten already. I wondered why he had not yet come to school but since it was not his first time being that late I wasn't all too worried. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "The boy! The boy!" Nonso came hurriedly towards me, panicking. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Nonso, ginikwa."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Ikem oh. O Ikem oh. Kedu ihe anyi ga-akoro mma ya."
                <br>
                <br>
                "Bia, ginikwa bu nke ahu. Did he do anything to you?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Ikem anyi anorozi."
                <br>
                <br>
                I don't know how to explain it but at that instant my life dropped out of my body. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "Ho.... How..... Gi..... Gini..... Gini mere....?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Okwa this morning. Accident oh. Moto kuru ya ka o na-abia akwukwo. Ikem anyi oh."
                <br>
                <br>
                I noticed the students were arching their necks towards us to know what we were talking about. I managed to hold Nonso and walk to the staffroom. There, I sank into tears. 
                <br>
                <br>

                Some people say it was the land issue that killed his father that also killed his son, that when untimely death comes for one's father it takes the son with him as extra. It didn't matter to me whether his death was natural or orchestrated by people. It couldn't bring him back. Achebe writes that "When suffering comes knocking on your door and you say you don't have a seat for him he tells you he came with a seat." I wonder if he was referring to Ikem's family. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Ikem.... My strength... That was what his father named him.... 
                <br>
                <br>
                Nkemefuna... Nkem.... May I never lose what's mine.... That's my son's name.

            <h4>I carefully unpacked a section of my bookshelf to get behind it. I have, over the years collected books of various topics and qualities, all of which I now refer to like my clothes and shoes because owning a study submerged in books has told on the size and quality of my wardrobe. My books are my clothes. So, I edged my clothes away to reveal a swollen folder-like object coated in dust, all the way to the tip of its pages.

                <br><br>
                
                Seven years ago, I had etched it there for safekeeping. Maybe I just desperately wanted to swim off
                
                the shore of the unbearable tug at my heart whenever I flipped through its pages. Today, I freed it
                
                from its corner with surprising strength and calm -two things I was deficient from some years ago.
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                Naomi stood gaping expectantly at me with those big, round eyes - her mother's carbon-copy. "Daddy, what is that?" She pointed at my hand. "And why is it so dirty?"
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                I sat down and busied myself with cleaning out the dust from its covers with a napkin, so I didn't
                
                respond to her question. It also helped me steady my heartbeat because anxiety had begun to settle in.
                <br><br>
                
                
                
                I flipped the cover open to reveal the first page, designed with photos plastered expertly with the aid of glue to create an impressive collage. I thought I was ready. I thought the years had faded most, if not all the hurt my heart had weathered.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "Daddy! You are crying!" I heard Naomi whisper to me; something she didn't have to do because we
                
                were alone in the study. Most importantly, we were the only two occupants to a mansion of multiple
                
                rooms and space large enough for a dozen people. Much like the dusty folder lying in front of me, every corner of this house is webbed in memories.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                I didn't move to wipe my tears because shame was less of a contender where pain reigned. So, I welcomed the tornado of emotions, surging through my veins, presenting themselves as tears before my little girl.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                I pulled her closer by the waist, unashamed of the stream on my face.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "Do you remember last week when you asked about your mother?" I asked her, also in a whisper.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "Hmm hmmm," She replied a little too flippant for my mood.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "...And I told you Mummy had travelled. Do you remember?" I asked amid a growing stream on my cheeks.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "You always say she travelled. Doesn't she want to come back? Does she not like us?" She played with her nails as her unassuming questions she set fire to my eyes and the rain came pouring.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "Naomi, your mother loves us so much. She loves you so much but she had to go. You can't see her but she is with us now". Somehow, she suddenly felt capable of comprehending the omniscience of a lost loved one.
                <br><br>
                
                
                
                "This is your mother." I pointed at a timeless photo of Mira, dressed in traditional attire, elegantly posed with a stellar smile.
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                "Do you remember her?" I took a chance on that question as she was only a little over two years
                
                when her mother passed away.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "Do you remember her?" I asked again, partially willing her to say yes, even though I knew the chances were next to none.
                <br><br>
                
                
                
                Naomi alternated her glances from me to the giant album in front of her. She bit her lip which was her
                
                contemplating to maybe tell me the truth or lie to spare my feelings. She had always been very intuitive
                
                as a child.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "No. I don't remember her" She replied, looking squarely in my eye.
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                "You were young when she left... when she slept, so you wouldn't remember her. But this is your
                
                mother" I pointed at another picture of us, kneeling for prayers on our wedding day. "This was Mummy and Daddy on our wedding day". I reached up to my cheeks to dry some of what was already an ocean.
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                Naomi watched me in silence and resumed staring at the album again. She didn't move to flip the pages and I was grateful for that. And when I had gathered myself and the ocean on my face had become a drizzle, I asked her to dish her food from the kitchen. She boisterously sprinted off from my side but she came back to whisper yet again.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "Mummy loves you too Daddy" before running off again.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                I smiled and whispered to the air I knew Mira occupied around me.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                "I love you too".
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                Then, I stood up and etched the not so dusty album, in front, away from its previous hideout.

                <br><br>
                to shudder life's tumor 
                <br><br>
                & my eyes become pages of sad songs 
                <br><br>
                with broken lyrics
                <br><br>

            <h4> 2019.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                
                Today, I find forgiveness. I am at the cemetery, staring at the marble headstone with 'Tolulope Titiloye Akanni, 1982-2015' engraved on it. It is the first time I've visited – the first time I've been able to visit – since Tolu died. I stare at the grave, shivering slightly. The bouquet in my hand jiggles lightly. There's a brisk wind. I should have worn a jacket or something. I dampen my lips and take a deep breath.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                
                “Hello, Tolu.”
                <br>
                “I brought you flowers,” I continue, holding the flowers forward, letting her see. “It's real. It has roses, hibiscus...other things. I don't know flowers, but that's what the florist I bought it from told me. It's ridiculous I know.” I'm rambling. My palms are sweaty.
                <br>
                “I'm so nervous. I don't know what to say.” I look up, look this way, that, breathing slowly to steady myself like the therapist taught me. 
                <br>
                My roiling stomach finally settles. 
                <br>
                “I'm sorry. For what I did. It was my fault.”
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Images flash before my eyes. The kitchen. A knife. I blink them away. It has not always been that easy to blink them away. Before, whenever they came, they became all-encompassing, filling up every part of my existence and stealing parts of my sanity every time. But now, it is.
                <br>
                “I shouldn't have... I should...” The tears gather at my throat, preventing words from coming out. I try to blink them away like the images. A few fall through, landing on the mound of earth which is choked with weeds. I wipe my eyes.
                <br><br>
                
                
                “I'm sorry for not visiting all this time. Please forgive me.”
                <br><br>
                
                
                I kneel now because it seems right. The earth is dry and small pebbles prick my knees. “Please know that no matter what happened, what I did, I loved you. Still do.” It was true. It's true. I lay the flowers on the grave, near the headstone because the weeds there are not as thick.
                <br>
                And, for the first time since that day in 2015, I feel relief. I shattered into a million tiny pieces when it happened. I've been gathering the pieces since then. But now, I have glued the first piece and the second together. And even though I will never be smooth like before, I won't be broken either.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “So babe, how's it over there?” I begin, feeling a new-found calm. “I'm finally beginning to manage things over here. The disorder. I take my meds regularly and it's helping. I'm mending.” I unclasp my hands and clasp them again. They're no longer sweaty.
                <br><br>
                
                
                “Good news. I got promoted.” Tolu deserves to know. She knew every good thing in my life while she still lived. She often was the reason for them. “I feel bad you're not here. I miss you so much”. It was almost painful. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                “You understood. You didn't tiptoe. Didn't explain away the things I did because of... You just understood.” 
                
                <br><br>
                
                There are so many things I want to say. That because of her, I opened many parts of myself which were locked so tight I didn't know they were there. That because of her, I survived. But I cannot find the words to say them. 
                <br>
                Finally, I settle for “I hope you're safe where you are. I love you. Always.” 
                
                <br><br>
                
                I stare at the colourful flowers, a sharp contrast to the dull browns and greens of the grave. The flowers are the first Tolu has gotten since she died because her grave doesn't get visits from family. She has no family. Hers disowned her when they found out we were a thing. My family has disowned me too, but that was after I threw hot water at Maami one time I was angry. I can't even remember why. I knew what I was doing when I did it, but I couldn't stop. By the time I was able to get to grips with myself, Baba had already decided, and no amount of pleas could change his mind.
                <br><br>
                
                
                After some time, I turn and walk out of the cemetery. The feeling as I leave is bittersweet. I've missed Tolu, and seeing the grave just gives everything a sense of finality. The relief, the peace I feel walking out gives me a feeling of lightness, despite my grief. I feel like I'm floating. The first time I remember ever feeling this way was the day I met Tolu.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                I was going home from school that day. The sun was boiling, determined to scorch everything before the clouds on the horizon closed in. The white-and-black regulation dress stifled. My head was pounding and I longed for her bed. Despite the scorching heat, I walked briskly to the park. My heart was racing. Sweat poured out of my body. My thoughts were jumbled, flowing into and out of each other like a river. Water's blue, they lied when they said it was tasteless because it wasn’t and wouldn't it be nice if I could just teleport to my bed and why do feet smell and noses run when feet are used for running and noses are used for smelling. When I reached the park, all thoughts ceased. There were too many students and no buses. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                
                
                “Please what happened”, I asked one of the many students milling about, yanking him towards me. He told me, the bus drivers were on strike. There was no way home. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                The main school gate was a 15-minute drive from the park. I was going to walk that distance under the angry sun. The sun wasn't that hot anyway, I thought, wiping the many rivulets on my forehead. I was about to start walking when a taxi driver called out “Tanke!” Students sprinted desperately to it, every one of them wanting to get home. I was there too, struggling for the taxi, elbowing and shoving. I felt explosive strength, boundless energy. I could do anything. Then, a boy shoved me with his shoulders, slamming my body against the side of the taxi. Without thinking, or maybe thinking too fast, I grabbed the boy's arm and clamped down hard with my teeth, tasting the stale saltiness of sweat. It was like I was watching myself doing this. The boy howled like a wounded wolf. It was frightening. Hands were around me, struggling to tear me off. Let go, Lola, come on. This is insane. The voice in my head was drowned out by all the remaining screams inside my head, and my teeth just clamped down harder. I knew what I was doing was crazy but I couldn't stop. The thing about bipolar disorder is that it makes you lose insight, narrowing your focus to a needlepoint so that everything and everyone else gets lost in the periphery. It is total self-absorption.
                <br><br>
                
                
                When my heart stopped racing and the screams in my head stopped, I was sitting on a hard-backed chair in an air-conditioned room, waiting to 'face panel'.
                <br><br>
                *
                <br><br>
                The disciplinary panel was merciless, brutal with their questions.
                <br>
                “Are you sane?”
                <br>
                “Can't you talk?”
                <br>
                “What is wrong with you?”
                
                <br>
                
                The sort of questions my family asked me for years, the sort they asked when Maami took me to that prayer house for deliverance when I was nine and the woli stripped me naked and tied me down and sprinkled holy water on me. My body itched all over. Then, he produced a rawhide whip and flogged me with it to ‘remove the demons’. I screamed so much my throat ached –pleas, then promise after promise. The demon had left. I would never act like before again. I would be a good girl. My behaviour would change. Everything stopped when I passed out. When I finally got home three days later, back raw and voice hoarse, I lay in bed for days, pretending to be sick, unwilling to do anything. Feeling an unrelenting and insidious apathy. Then, like a switch, I suddenly got over-energised and so restless, and so very angry, that I eventually got into a fistfight with the bully that lived on my street. He'd beaten me silly.
                <br>
                “We see here that you have a... record from secondary school”, the voice of a panelist dragged me back to the room. “What happened?”, the leader of the panel asked, peering at me over the spectacles balanced on his wide nose.

                What happened was that I had chased two boys to within an inch of their lives, a jagged bottle in my hand, when they wolf-whistled at me. I ran and ran that day. Wouldn't stop. Didn't want to stop.
                
                <br><br>
                
                But I didn't tell the panel.
                <br>
                “You're not talking abi?”, the plump woman on the panel said, her mouth downturned in a condemning scowl. “Who do you think you are that we will ask you question and you'll not answer? Who are you? Ehn?”
                <br>
                “Dr. Mrs., please calm down,” one of the panelists soothed, his hands outstretched in a placating gesture.
                <br>
                “No wonder she's here! Bad child!” the plump woman began again, throat veins bulging, voice shriller than before. “No wonder she...”
                <br>
                “Dr. Mrs., please calm down,” the lead panelist said, “Let me finish asking her these questions.” The woman stopped, although her red lipstick-covered mouth still quivered.
                <br>
                “Hmm. Your medical records show you have bipolar disorder,” the panel leader said, adjusting the spectacles on his nose and flipping through my records.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I went back to the hospital the day I discovered. I remembered the sense of vindication I felt when the doctor told me that I had bipolar disorder, unspecified. 
                
                
                <br><br>
                “Bipolar disorder is characterised by manic episodes, intense highs where the person is over-energised and restless, then depressive episodes, lows where the sufferer will be unusually tired and melancholic. Some sufferers may experience mixed episodes, and some may experience hallucinations and/or psychosis....” The doctor rambled on, but I didn't hear anything. I was giddy. I had finally discovered what caused those extreme highs when I felt invincible and all-powerful and overconfident and did all sorts of things, and the plunging lows, when I felt too tired, or extremely apathetic or suicidal and where I regretted things I did while manic. All of those things were not my fault. It was bipolar. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                It's not my fault, I wanted to scream to the world. Maami, Baami. It wasn't me all along. There is no demon. Nothing is wrong with me. At least, not in the way you think. The doctor gave me medication for the disorder that day. And that day, I started having dreams of a normal life.
                <br>
                How very wrong I was. Because people who lived normal lives did not have their aunts knock on their doors every weekend holding herbal mixtures and telling them to drink it, because “...na ogbonge herbal remedy. E go cure anything, even HIV.” I would smile shyly and collect this week's mixture and add it to the others I had already collected. It would sit there, unopened until Aunty Ronke brought another one. They all sat there till Mom got rid of them one day. 
                <br>
                Normal people did not have friends bringing them 'calming soups' and walking on eggshells around them, as if they were insane, raging bulls; they did not have classmates inviting them to church so they could “...encounter God so you will no longer be mad.” They did not have their grouses flippantly ignored because “I know it's the bipolar you have that's talking because you are overreacting”; or genuine moments where they were depressed and sad explained away because “Thank God, you aren’t depressed every time. At least, you have energised moments that make up for the depression.” Normal people did not have to face every one of their emotions head-on and second-guess themselves constantly.
                
                <br><br>
                
                The meds did not change anything. I still became frequently manic, even more than before, and when I eventually fell from those manic heights, it was long and hard.
                <br><br>
                
                
                The panel interrupted my thoughts again. “Well, we've seen what we have to see. Wait outside, we'll call you in when we make our decision.” 
                <br>
                *
                <br>
                The panel gave me a month's suspension and told me that the sentence was reduced due to my disorder, with the added warning that if I couldn't control herself, it would be expulsion next time. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                I walked out feeling I had finally reached the breaking point. I felt incredibly tired and started thinking that maybe it would be better for everyone if I wasn't around anymore because there was no way she could hurt anyone if I was dead.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I sat in front of the Faculty of Arts building, head between my knees, brooding, and that was when Tolu breezed into my life.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “Sister. Hello. Is everything alright?” The voice was full of concern. It was annoying. 
                <br>
                I nodded absently and wiped my eyes, wishing that whoever it was could just leave me alone. I'm not alright, I thought, but what can you do about it? What can anyone do about it?
                <br>
                “But you're crying.”
                <br>
                I raised her head then and my first look at Tolu was a lanky, dark-skinned girl with bony arms and concerned eyes.
                <br>
                “Can I sit?,” Tolu asked, and then dropped down on the seat next to me. It grated on my nerves. Please just leave me alone. 
                <br>
                “My name is Tolu. I'm in Faculty of Arts. What's your name?”
                <br>
                I didn't answer then, just stared forward.
                <br>
                “I can see from your ID card and dress that you're in Law,” Tolu continued. “I really like Law, but I wasn't able to get in.”
                <br>
                This girl should leave me alone, I recall stopping just short of saying it out loud. 
                <br>
                “But I also like Performing Arts, and I think I want to act full-time when I graduate,” Tolu rambled on. “Because of that, I'm basically fatherless. But in the future, when I’m finally famous, he'll now say 'Tolu, I'm proud of you’”.
                <br>
                I smiled then. It was tentative, more a please-go-away smile than a keep-talking smile but Tolu apparently took it as encouragement. 
                <br>
                “So, what’s wrong? Maybe I can help,” she asked, her face serious. 
                <br>
                Everything is wrong. I’m wrong. “Everything,” I said. “But you can’t help. Nobody can.”
                <br>
                “Ok.”
                <br>
                This simple, matter-of-fact acceptance surprised me. Normally, people tried to wheedle or nag me to talk, or simply told me to snap out of it because the country was hard and I wasn’t the only one that had problems. 
                <br>
                “Talking about it might help though,” she said. “I know that it will help me do amebo at least.”
                <br>
                For some reason, I found it funny. I smiled more genuinely then. Maybe I like Tolu.
                <br>
                “My name is Lola. Doctor said I’m bipolar.” That was me in a nutshell, wasn’t it? Lola. Bipolar. Female. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                I told Tolu everything then, from the early manic-depressive episodes of my childhood to the day I was diagnosed. to the struggle in the park, to the one-month suspension. Everything gushed out. Tolu just listened. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                “...it’s why I don’t want you here. Leave me alone. I can injure you and I’ll not know, and then you’ll hate me. Something is wrong with me,” I said, almost pleading. I liked Tolu. She seemed nice. I didn’t want to hurt her.
                
                <br><br>
                
                The silence afterwards was thick and heavy.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “No. Nothing is wrong with you,” Tolu had finally said, in her matter-of-fact way that made you believe whatever she was saying was true and unarguable. 
                <br>
                I just stared. I didn’t know what to say.
                <br>
                “Oya, come,” Tolu said, like we were old friends. “Today’s my birthday, and I want to buy ice-cream. But there’s no one to eat it with.”
                <br>
                “Don’t worry. I’m fine.”
                <br>
                “OK then, I’ll sit down here with you.”
                <br>
                We sat down there in comfortable silence for what seemed to me like hours, though it must have been only a few minutes. 
                <br>
                “The park wasn’t supposed to happen,” I suddenly blurted out, as much to defend my behaviour to this nice girl as to fill the silence. “I took my meds. They’re supposed to make me normal.”
                <br>
                Much later, I would learn the meds were not the correct ones, that they gave me antidepressants instead of the medication I needed.
                <br>
                “See,” she said “Look at me. It has happened. Past. You have one month free, are you going to spend it with that sad look on your face? Hmm? Let’s go to my house, devour ice-cream. Just for this night, at least. Ok?”
                <br>
                I wanted to go then, but I still refused, suggesting that we exchange phone numbers instead.
                <br>
                Tolu said no, pleaded and wheedled until I finally caved. 
                <br>
                “OK. I’ll go. Just for this night.”
                <br><br>
                
                
                My life was never the same after that.
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                I arrive home, and for the first time since everything broke, I walk straight to the bedroom we shared. It’s been locked all this while. The door creaks jarringly when I slowly push it open. Dust covers every surface and floats visibly around the room. The room smells musty. Thick cobwebs form irregular patterns on the ceiling. Everything is still as it was, untouched. The wardrobe door, open, and Tolu’s clothes and mine, organised into business and casual, spiffy suits, blouses and skirts with a few sweatshirts and jeans thrown in; Tolu’s Access Bank ID Card; a now-yellowed flier for an audition she had planned to go for; my shoes, hers; the bed with rumpled sheets. And the dangling belt looped around the ceiling fan, where I tried to end everything that day.
                <br>
                <br>
                *
                <br>
                <br>
                The day everything broke was a clear and bright Saturday. We both lounged on the bed that morning, sprawled over each other. 
                <br>
                
                <br>
                “So babe, were you able to collect it?,” Tolu asked, her first words since we woke up that morning and shared companionable silence. She was talking about the medication I was supposed to get from the hospital the previous day. I had gone to the hospital on the Monday of that week and they had told me to come back on Wednesday. The meds were unavailable. When I went back, the hospital was closed. Doctors were on strike. I told Tolu all these, peppered with gossip and interesting anecdotes from my time at the hospital. 
                <br>
                Tolu sat cross-legged on the bed listening to me, eyes eager, a grin plastered on her face that she didn’t know of. As I talked, we started to laugh. I laughed mostly because Tolu laughed. Her laugh was peculiar, a deep and rumbling guffaw that made one think of a beer-bellied middle-aged man.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I didn’t have a care in the world. I hadn’t taken my meds for a week, and I felt fine. Wonderful. Content as I laughed with her. 
                <br>
                Some minutes later, Tolu went out to buy something, and nothing was the same after that.
                <br><br>
                *
                <br><br>
                When Tolu left, something in me snapped. I felt dizzy and closed my eyes to steady myself. The room was no longer empty when I opened them. The woli of that prayer house Maami took me to when I was nine was in the room, his white garb stained a brownish-red the colour of rust. He came straight for me, but instead of a bell and the whip he always held in my memories, an axe swung from his fist.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I gave a surprised, strangled yelp, then started to scramble backwards. Sweat instantly gathered in beads on my forehead, in streamlets down my back, the damp patches under my armpit.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “What are you doing here? Why are you here? How did you get in?” I said scrambling back on the bed, heart pounding from fear. The woli said nothing. He just walked, in slow measured steps, axe in hand, towards the bed, towards me. I cried out and sprinted out of the bedroom. And saw him again. Two hims. The one in the bedroom joined them. The three walked towards me, steps eerily choreographed. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                “You’re not real. Tolu’s coming. You’re not real. You’re fake. It’s... it’s a dream,” I rambled, the words flying, fast and furious, out of my mouth. “It’s my mind. You’re not here. It’s a dream... a dream...yes... yes.”
                
                
                <br><br>
                Then I bumped into something and felt hot breath on my neck that made the hairs on my body stand up. I turned slowly and was met with the woli, axe raised high above the head. I screamed and ran into the kitchen. They were six now, and they crowded in the kitchen door, and one-by-one, they walked towards me. I grabbed a frying pan and hurled it. They kept coming. I started grabbing whatever was handy and throwing it at them, frantic, sweat pouring down my back. Spoons made of stainless steel, ceramic plates which shattered when they hit the floor, a grater. It had no effect. They just walked and walked, chasing me around the kitchen. 
                <br><br>
                “Lola, you okay?” one suddenly said, and I jumped, startled. None had said anything until that point... and it talked with Tolu’s voice, but with a very gravelly undertone, like stones scraping together under a soft pillow. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                “Tolu? That you?” I asked. Hope flickered in me. 
                <br>
                “You don’t deserve all you have.” The multiple wolis had merged into one, and it took a big step towards me. “You have to pay.” It came towards me with the axe now.
                <br>
                My scrabbling, searching, desperate hand closed around a kitchen knife. I couldn’t see anything, couldn’t stop myself. A red wall slid in front of my eyes, blocking off everything. I sprang forward. And stabbed and stabbed. I didn’t pay heed to anything. I stabbed until it no longer moved, until the knife was slippery in my hand. Until I closed my eyes and slipped into silence. 
                <br>
                When I opened her eyes, I was on the kitchen floor, covered in blood. 
                <br>
                Tolu lay by my side, sporting dark holes. Dead.
                <br>
                I screamed.
                <br><br>
                *
                <br><br>
                I looped the belt around the fan, forming a noose. I couldn’t live without her. I deserved the punishment of death. Nothing was worth living for anyway. I slipped my head into the noose, and it squeezed tight around my neck. My head started pounding and my neck throbbed. My fingers clawed at the noose. I could think of nothing, except loosening it. Everything flashed red and black until my world was darkness, the only light a pinpoint between my eyes. I could feel my life slipping away. Slowly, surely. 
                <br>
                Then the noose loosened, and I dropped to the floor. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t punish myself. I was a coward now too. 
                <br>
                I walked to the door opened it, and walked out. 
                <br>
                And kept walking. 
                <br><br>
                *
                <br><br>
                I don’t remember what happened next. What I remember next is finding myself in a hospital. The therapist told me that I had walked into the hospital, feet bleeding and scraped and caked with mud, gone to the receptionist, and told him “Please go to my house. My friend is dead. I killed her. Call the police,” then collapsed on the floor. They admitted me.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I woke up in the hospital, a tube running into my arm, hot needles of pain dancing all over my feet. The doctor told me to rest. They were going to talk to me later. They were administering painkillers to dull the pain. I fell asleep. That’s when I had the first nightmare.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I was back in the kitchen. The wolis chased me and cornered me. They moved slowly towards me, axes swinging. My hands frantically searched around, and then closed around the knife. I brought it up and pointed it towards the apparitions. Then the knife disappeared, and they merged into one huge figure and slashed at me with the axe. Then I was the one holding the axe and slashing. Slashing at Tolu, who wore a beatific smile, her body bearing holes and the knife in her belly. 
                <br>
                I woke up screaming. The doctors rushed in.
                <br><br>
                *
                <br><br>
                The next few years were the worst years of my life. I had nightmares – demonic dreams where I would find myself chased with axes by the shadowy figures wearing long white robes which were stained and torn. Sometimes they would catch me, and as they swung the axes, Tolu would be the one lying on the ground, bruised and scraped. And I’d be the one holding the axe or knife swinging, deadly accurate, towards her. I could never stop myself in time, and she’d fall down bleeding, smiling at me. Sometimes I would walk and walk, shrouded in thick fog, calling out to Tolu until my voice was raw and gravelly and my feet were battered and blistered. I’d wake from the nightmares screaming or crying. I was afraid to sleep, and at a point, I couldn’t. 
                <br>
                The meds didn’t seem to work anymore. During the afternoons, I would sit, filled with despair and self-loathing. Hating myself. Wanting to die. I tried occasionally, pulling out the syringe feeding drips into my hand and trying to bleed out; or pretending to take the painkiller tablets and accumulating them, and overdosing.
                <br><br>
                
                
                The therapist took me in. I lived with her during the worst of those times.
                <br>
                And, like a huge ship slowly turning, changing directions, I healed. I could go to work again and do other things without the therapist being there to talk me out of hurting myself. 
                <br>
                And I could finally face Tolu. 
                <br><br>

                “So, how did you feel when you went to Tolu’s grave?” the therapist asks, sitting on the sofa I had just scrubbed. This is the first time she is coming to the house. She wanted to check in on me.
                <br>
                “I guess I feel okay,” I answer.
                <br>
                I mean it too.

            <h4>Breeze blows over the ocean; gently, softly.
                <br>
                The waves shudder in response, gently,
                <br>
                Softly; the aftermath bare on its surface.
                <br>
                You hover above me,
                <br>
                Your essence blowing over me, gently;
                <br>
                Softly, you calm me like the ocean breeze.
                <br>
                You are the sun to my sea shore,
                <br>
                Shining down in all your glory.
                <br>
                Bright, yet gentle,
                <br>
                Soft; you shine…warm.
                <br>
                Your hands hold me, your heartbeat soothes my soul,
                <br>
                My body blends into yours, limbs all tangled up.
                <br>
                Gently, softly, we become one.

                Have you had enough?
                <br>
                Are you not entertained?
                <br>
                Do you want more?
                <br>
                No, your time is up.
                <br>

                You’ve had your “I love you”s
                <br>
                And now you are through.
                <br>
                Get going girl!

                You’ve fought. 
                <br>
                You’ve made up. 
                <br>
                You’ve kissed and made love.
                <br>
                But...there's a but!
                <br>
                Get going, girl. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                You want it all and more
                <br>
                With him; you think you’re sure. 
                <br>
                But, are you?
                <br>
                Nothing else to do...so
                <br>
                Get going, girl.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Thing is, you do love him.
                <br>
                You are enough, sometimes, with him. 
                <br>
                You can see a future, with him.
                <br>
                So is it really time to leave?
                <br>
                Get going? Girl?
                
                <br><br>
                
                Do you want to?
                
                <br><br>
                
                Do you think you can?
                
                
                <br><br>
                Do you even know how to get going, girl?

            <h4>I started screaming.

                <br><br>
                
                Suddenly I blinked and I was in front of a mirror, still brushing my hair (I really shouldn't have settled for low-quality weave). I sighed and walked into my room to get my iPad. I tried not to think of the vision I just had but I couldn't.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Who is Anita? Why did I seem to know her like a best friend? What did that vision mean?
                <br><br>
                
                
                But in all honesty, I was glad to be out of that vision. That... What was that? 
                
                
                <br><br>
                I kept trying to forget its face. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                It had a two-foot long face (if you can call that a face). The "face" had this dark five-inch hole that
                <br>
                seemed to lead to...God knows where. Its body was covered in olive green scales and somewhere around the sides of its "face" were thorns.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Not horns, thorns.
                <br><br>
                
                
                They looked like steel spearheads. The things that were supposed to be its eyes were like fire, but black. I can't explain that for the life of me. Then it had these dirty large pitchforks for hands, or at least that's what they seemed like. It had a tail or something, I can't tell what thatthing behind it was. I think it was another hand. And it was at least 8 feet tall. That's all I remember. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Thankfully.
                <br>
                How did it fit in that bathroom? More importantly, whose bathroom was that and why were my things in it? And again... WHO IS ANITA?!!
                <br><br>
                At this point, I remembered what it was looking at.
                <br><br>
                
                
                It wasn't looking at my face as it held me; the thought of its hands in me made me cringe; but it was looking above me. Like I was taller than my 5'7. Now that I thought about it, I wonder, what was it looking at?!
                
                
                <br><br>
                It didn't occur to me before but it seemed strange that it was holding on to me like I was some old friend and it was staring right over my head. I shrugged off the memory, deciding I'll deal with it later. Church first.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I started heading towards the door to walk out when I saw her...
                <br>
                A little girl, not more than 10, chewing furiously on something. She had a half frown and it looked like she had been playing in the dirt, because she had brown stains all over her white dress. Even her mouth was stained so I thought it was probably food or something.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Wait, what is she doing here?! How did she get here?! Who is she? I froze, staring at her. She wiped her mouth and giggled. As she giggled a dark liquid spurted out of her mouth. At this point, I started to panic. What if she's hurt? Then I noticed what was in her other hand.
                <br><br>
                
                
                No. It can't be what... No. Is that...a person's heart?!
                <br>
                My heart skipped a beat. I blinked furiously wishing and praying it was just another vision. I'd really never had visions twice in less than 20 minutes, but I needed that to happen at that point.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I took deep breaths and shook my head several times. Still nothing.
                <br><br>
                
                
                Then she started to walk slowly towards me, a smile on her face. I backed away, not wanting to take my eyes off her. She started running. At first, I tried to be brave and just keep still to see what happened next, but then she stopped in front of me and opened her mouth wide, and what
                <br>
                I saw...
                
                <br><br>
                
                Help me! Help me! Help me!!!
                
                <br><br>
                
                I'm only thinking of help, I'm not even trying to run away. Then I felt something...or someone...pull me from inside my body and I found myself falling...falling...falling...where?!!
                
                <br><br>
                
                I couldn't see, I was rubbing my eyes as I fell and I still only saw black.
                <br>
                Am I blind? What is happening?!! Then I stopped falling, but I still couldn't see.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I called out to anyone. Deep down I was still telling myself that I didn't actually fall into the little girl's mouth.
                
                <br>
                
                How? Who falls into a person's mouth?! What am I thinking?!! I told myself to stop being stupid and find a way out of there. But how? Am I even still alive? What if this is what death looks like? What if I'm in hell?
                <br>
                That thought sprung me up and I started trying to feel my way out of there. I tried not to worry about the fact that I still couldn't see. Maybe it's this place.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I reassured myself that if I could get out of there, I'll get my sight back. With that thought giving me a little strength, I moved forward a bit. And it was as I concentrated on moving that another thing came to my notice.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I am floating. There is literally nothing solid under my feet.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I felt instant panic. What is happening?! Am I still falling?! And that was when I started praying under my breath. Our father...Hail Mary...Holy Mary Mother... In the Name of the Father... From that I graduated to full blown prayers, then I heard someone chuckle.
                
                
                <br><br>
                "There is nothing demonic about this my dear, so you can stop praying now."
                <br>
                I tried to find the source of the voice and remembered again that I couldn't see. I started shaking.
                
                
                <br><br>
                Who's there? Why can't I see them? Where am I?
                
                <br><br>
                
                I waited to hear the voice again but there was silence. In frustration, I started sobbing. At that moment I realized the voice sounded familiar and I stopped crying long enough to try to place the voice. It was still in my head so I used that echo to think...
                <br><br>
                
                
                Oh...wait...
                
                
                <br><br>
                I remembered where I last heard the voice and felt a cold chill run through me. It's not possible. This can't be... Can it?
                
                 <br><br>
                
                "Dear girl, don't give yourself a headache. This is your show. You're the Ringmaster."
                
                <br><br>
                
                I told him I didn't understand him and he was silent again. I screamed in frustration and swayed a little to the left and...I felt some...thing...someone...
                
                <br><br>
                
                Someone is right next to me. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no...
                <br>
                I called out to whatever it was and the answer I got still makes me ill. It sounded like a painful moan. Whoever or whatever was beside me sounded like they were in pain.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Who is there? Are you okay?
                <br><br>
                "Awww, so much compassion for something you can't even see. Touching, really."
                
                <br><br>
                
                I asked the voice why I couldn't see and he laughed.
                <br><br>
                
                
                "Why are you asking me? You're the one who has chosen whether to have your sight or not. I told you this is your show."
                
                <br><br>
                
                I didn't understand him but I decided to be brave and ask the pressing question first.
                <br><br>
                
                
                Are you who I think you are?
                <br><br>
                "And who would that be?"
                <br><br>
                My father.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I heard the loudest most hysterical laughter ever and I flinched a little. What was so funny? As soon as the laughter subsided he started coughing. Then the cough changed and it seemed like he was choking.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Are you okay?
                <br><br>
                "I'm as okay as you wish me to be, dear girl"
                <br><br>
                What does that mean? Why are you talking in riddles?
                <br><br>
                
                
                Then in his silence, a bright light suddenly came on and almost blinded me. Blinded?! I can see!!! I looked around and then as I turned left, I saw... It? Her? Him? What on earth is beside me?
                
                
                <br><br>
                Then I noticed something a little too late, it hadn't been moaning in pain. It had been feeding...On...
                <br>
                ...IT HAD BEEN EATING MY FATHER'S STOMACH! Jesus!
                
                <br><br>
                
                I backed away and the thing kept its eyes on me. I looked around and there were literally no doors leading out of there. It looked like we were in a hole. I tried not to panic again but I was failing miserably. I couldn't tell whether my father was still alive or not.
                
                <br><br>
                
                What is this thing? This...creature was even worse and more repulsive than the one in my vision. Vision. This should be a vision. God please let it be a vision.
                
                
                <br><br>
                The creature turned its yellow eyes to me and held my gaze. My back was against the wall so there was literally nowhere to go. I was just there, telling myself, if I get eaten then so be it. I was tired. I needed this to be over.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Then the creature crawled slowly towards me. It didn't take its eyes off me as it advanced. My heart was beating so fast.
                <br>
                So this is how I die? With no explanations, nothing?
                
                
                <br><br>
                I couldn't even cry at this point. As it got closer I shut my eyes and prepared for the worst. I felt it get 3ft close... 2ft...1ft... I felt things like centipedes crawling up my body but I was determined
                not to scream. I think I was really just emotionally and mentally exhausted at that point. The sound of the...things crawling up my body was all I could hear. Then...
                <br>
                ...I opened my eyes...
                <br>
                ...there was a mirror in front of me again and I caught my reflection in the mirror...
                <br>
                Jesus... Jesus... Jesus... No...
                
                <br><br>
                
                In the mirror, I stared at my eyes...if you could call them that. The red-black holes... I lifted my pitchfork hands to my face and touched the spearhead thorns... I tried to scream and I growled...
                <br><br>
                
                
                ...this is not happening... No...
                <br>
                I shut my eyes and opened them again and there was a bloody human heart in my hand and the
                <br>
                taste of blood and raw meat on my tongue...
                
                
                <br><br>
                Yes. Yes I am it. I have always been it. And her. And him.
                <br>
                I heard this in my head. I felt myself smiling. I felt satisfaction taking over me. I raised the heart up and ran my tongue over it. Hmmm.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Do you know me? Do you love me? Do you? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? What...am I?

            <h1>THINGS TO DO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS</h1>
            <h3>Amarachukwu Nnoli</h3>
            </a>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="pdate">
            <h6><i>September 2020</i></h6>
        </div>
        <div class="content"> 
            <h4>The only time of the year you received gifts was Christmas. These gifts were not preempted by “I will buy you *insert something expensive you don’t like* if you pass your exams at the top of your class.” (You hated equations and cramming the periodic table and your economics teacher was such a bore, so you often failed.)

                <br><br>
                
                Before that time of the year, you would do these things in a sequence. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                Firstly you would open freezer doors, letting the cold air hit your face — rubbing frozen sachets of water on your cheeks when Mum was not looking —because Lagos harmattan did not feel like cold at all and that’s the closest to the winter you binge-watched in soap operas you would ever get.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Secondly, small artificial pine trees would be put up in the far corner of the sitting room. Mum would wrap them with ropes of tiny colorful light bulbs then call you from your room to crown it with a star at the topmost single branch poking out. Last year you broke your ankle trying to reach up to the treetop. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Thirdly, you would dream about one day — hoping with all your might — kissing Nnamdi under the mistletoe while Justin Bieber’s "Mistletoe" played in the background. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Lastly, you would pack boxes filled with clothes and take a road trip to Dad’s village even though his parents died five years before your birth, so what point was there to going every single year? Dad never let you or Mum sleep over at her village house just 30 minutes away from his. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Eventually, Dad would permit you a visit to Mama Ogidi, Mum’s Mother, who was your favorite grandma because in your defense, you never met the other, and she looked mean in pictures. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Mama Ogidi’s wardrobe was filled with tiny leather purses. Her wine and white coloured duplex afforded her the luxury of having a whole room for this wardrobe. This was where you ran to after hugging your frail grandmother till she was out of breath. After, you played with the purses, finding a new one each year. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                When tiredness turns your lips downward, droops your eyelids and makes your stomach rumble, Mama Ogidi would set down a huge plate of food. Jollof rice, pieces of chicken and very soft, oily, fried, slightly burnt plantain slices, just how you liked them. Mum always said they were unhealthy for a boy your age but Mama always waved her off, 
                
                <br><br>
                
                     “Rapu nwatakili k’orie n’ni, leave him to eat”
                
                <br><br>
                
                A satisfying exhaustion would induce sleep. But Mum would always wake you up because Dad would freak if you slept over at Mama’s. So you wake up groggy till Mama calls you aside, thrusts a thousand naira note and a purse (pink in color this year) into your hands and whispers in your ear, 
                
                <br><br>
                
                “I hope this one sits well in your collection, my boy” 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Throughout the journey back to Lagos, you stay quiet, the thoughts of Nnamdi on your mind. You wonder if he would like this one better on you. You finger the golden handle, trace the rough yet smooth leather, and rub the large buckle against your cheek. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                When it is your turn to say the fourth decade of the rosary, you absentmindedly replace Hail Mary’s with Hail Mama till Dad stops the car to glare at you.

                or compelled us to read,
                
                yet we would sit
                
                savouring the solemnity
                
                of poems
                
                written with unwashed hands
                
                sipping cups of green tea.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Often love tales rated 18,
                
                sung with emotions high.
                
                Of hate speech raw and untainted
                
                and polite stories of homicide
                
                beheld upon our laps.
                
                <br><br>
                
                No one told us
                
                that we could handpick characters
                
                in whom we delight
                
                yet never become.
                
                The ones who survived through blemish
                
                Painted in stanzas and lyrics.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Free and deserving,
                
                our bones began to hope
                
                for the magic encrypted,
                
                shrouded in pages by sages
                
                called poets.
                
                <br><br>
                
                We saved precious lines
                
                hoping they’d somehow
                
                free us
                
                or perhaps enslave us
                
                in the small possibilities
                
                that chariots could ride on sea
                
                and whales float on dry land.
                
                <br><br>
                
                We didn’t have
                
                the spirits the poets owned
                
                yet we choose to believe
                
                that life could be poems.
                
                So we read each one over
                
                to rid any disbelief.

            <h4>Part 1. The Taxi.
                <br>
                I remember the weight of her head on my right shoulder as I stared ahead. My mind in a haze, sleepy yet alert and aware, eyes lit up by the orange lights of the cars in the street. It always fascinated me how someone as loud and manic as she could look so peaceful and small when she slept. I couldn’t see her lips but I knew they were parted, soft whimpers escaping from them. We were both worn out after the activities of the day. She dozed off as soon as we entered the taxi, stealing away the last chance I had to persuade her to stay and if I couldn’t persuade her, I could have talked to her about anything. I needed every bit of time I could get to spend with her, no matter how little. I smiled, it was all I could do not to cry because I knew our forever had reached its limit and there was nothing I could do.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Part 2. A Year Before the Taxi
                <br>
                I was new in school. It was my second day there and I was in the bathroom along with other girls from my year. We had just finished P.E and were refreshing before our next class. After my cold shower, I tied a white towel and sat on a bench that was in the bathroom. Students were chitchatting, all still excited about seeing their friends after a long holiday. I just sat there with my head down, waiting for my body to dry.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “Does anyone have an extra tie I can borrow here?” I heard a girl say. I raised my head, that was when I first saw her. She was tall and had very long blue braids. Her skirt was short and her shirt unbuttoned, exposing her bra. No one answered her. I had an extra tie but I wasn’t sure if I should offer it to her.
                <br><br>
                “Please I have a class now and if I run back to the dorms to get it, I’m going to be late,” she said desperately. I reached for my bag and brought out the tie. She had already given up at that point and was buttoning up her shirt. I walked over quietly to her and handed her the tie “here” I said, extending my hand to give her the tie. She looked up. “Wow, thanks. You’re a lifesaver. I promise to give it back. What is your room number?” She was already tying it around her neck now, clearly in a hurry.
                <br><br>
                “Uhm…..” I was struggling to remember. I was there for only a day so I kept forgetting things. Before I could remember, she snatched her bag and dashed out of the bathroom, yelling “Thank you” as she left. I was sure I was never going to see my tie again.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I spent my lunch in the cafeteria alone, hoping to see the blue-haired girl again, not really because I wanted my tie back but because I just wanted to see her again. Lunch break ended and there was still no sign of her. I left the cafeteria dejected.
                
                
                <br><br>
                A week passed by before I got to see her again. It was on a Saturday; I was on my bed reading a book but there was too much noise coming from another room on our floor. There was loud music and I couldn’t concentrate so I went out to see what the cause of the hubbub was. Clutching my book to my chest, I followed the sound of the music to find the room it was coming from. I found the room and knocked on the door loudly. A short girl opened the door, frowning. “What do you want?” She said.
                <br><br>
                “You’re being loud,” I said. She rolled her eyes. “And what about it?” She scowled.
                
                
                <br><br>
                “You’re disturbing people who want to do something important with their night” I retorted.
                <br><br>
                “Oh, you mean important things like reading a boring book?” She chuckled at her own joke.
                <br><br>
                “It’s an interesting book” I held the book up to her face.
                <br><br>
                “Girl it’s Saturday. Have fun and leave us alone” she scoffed. Right before she closed the door, my eyes caught the eyes of the girl with the blue hair. My heart started pounding and I turned on my heels, running to my room. I slammed the door behind me, my back against it trying to catch my breath. Then someone knocked and it startled me. I opened the door. It was the blue girl. “Hey I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” she said. She had a beautiful smile that exposed the gap in her teeth. Her eyes also smiled when her lips did. I was awestruck and couldn’t reply to her.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “Can I come in?” She said as she walked past me to enter the room. It wasn’t even a request because she was already looking around my room at that point. I had girly stickers all over the walls and I was afraid she’d judge me. “Cool stickers” She said. I was relieved. Except maybe she was making fun of them. I couldn’t tell. Girls like her aren’t usually nice. They can be nice to save face but it was usually never genuine. “Thanks”. I mumbled. She stopped looking at the decorations now and turned her attention back to me. She smiled again. “I’ve been carrying your tie everywhere I went hoping to bump into you” she finally said after I broke eye contact. She had a tiny bag slung across her body. She opened it and retrieved the tie, handing it to me. I came forth to collect it but she drew her hand back. “Not so fast,” she said with a blank face. I was confused. What the hell was she going to do? “Tell me your name first,” she said, her eyes gleaming.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “It’s Nina,” I said. She noticed my uneasiness and walked up to me. She stood in front of me, taller than me by one foot. She took my hand and placed the tie in it. “Thank you for the tie, Nina,” she said without breaking eye contact.
                <br><br>
                
                
                “It’s fine….Uhm…” I didn’t know her name.
                <br><br>
                “Rose. My name is Rose” she shook my hand like we just signed a business contract.
                <br><br>
                “Nice to meet you Rose” I smiled for the first time.
                <br><br>
                “Likewise. Well, I should go. I’ve caused enough trouble” she said, her hands placed awkwardly in the skinny jeans that she wore with a denim jacket and crop top. I looked like her maid in a baggy t-shirt that reached my knees. She waved nervously with one hand and left, shutting the door behind her. I stood still in my spot, trying to process what just happened. My room smelled like her, and I wanted to run out and ask her to come back so the scent won’t evanesce. I looked at the tie in my hands. I brought it close to my nose and sniffed. Rose. She was all over it. I let out a tiny chuckle as I tossed the tie in my wardrobe. I’d never wear it again, I wanted it to only smell like her all the time. The smell of roses.

                Part 3. The Friendship
                <br>
                It was on a Monday and we were at assembly. I was standing behind when the principal announced a performance by a group of girls. The girls made their way to the stage. Rose was one of them. They started singing and Rose was dancing without a care in the world. She was in her own world where no one was watching. I longed to be that carefree one day. When the performance ended, I found myself applauding and cheering loudly. Probably hoping she’d notice me, she didn’t. I spent my morning in classes thinking about her. I couldn’t get her off my mind. I was enthralled.
                <br><br>
                
                
                During the lunch break, I sat alone as usual. I had no friends. Even my roommate didn’t want anything to do with me, she hardly even slept in our room, I was lonely most of the time. Just me, my books, and my thoughts. “You wanna get out of here?” I heard a voice say. I looked up. It was Rose. My face lit up like a firefly at dusk b Her hair was up in a ponytail. The skirt was longer today, resting just below her knee. She drew the chair opposite me and sat, her hands on the table as she stared at me waiting for an answer.
                <br><br>
                
                
                “I’m waiting for an answer….except maybe you have something to do,” she said after coming to the realization that I probably had other plans.
                <br><br>
                
                
                “I don’t know. I have class in ten minutes” I noticed her disappointment after I said that. I was as disappointed as she was.
                
                
                <br><br>
                “I have class too. We can skip them. I promise I’ll make it worthwhile” she flashed her million-dollar smile. I couldn’t resist. I followed her back to her room and we ate chocolates. She had loads of them. I ate till I couldn’t anymore. She put on music and pulled me up to dance. I tried to resist but she wouldn’t hear it. I told her I was shy and she said she wouldn’t judge. “Just close your eyes and pretend I’m not here. I’ll do it too” I watched her close her eyes and started dancing. I saw how fun it looked and I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try. Next thing I knew I was bobbing my head, throwing my hands everywhere, contorting my body, and jumping up and down. I stopped to catch my breath. Rose was no longer dancing, she was sitting on the bed staring at me. She smiled when I stopped. I felt the shyness return to me. I smiled and recoiled back into my shell. I sat on the other bed, her roommate’s.
                
                
                <br><br>
                “Would you like to join our singing group?” She asked.
                <br><br>
                “I can’t sing,” I said.
                <br><br>
                “You can’t sing or you’re afraid to sing in public?”
                <br><br>
                “I can’t sing. I sound like a frog” I said. She just chuckled and started playing with her hands.
                <br><br>
                “What club do you want to join then?” Asked Rose.
                <br><br>
                “Swimming. I love water” I said enthusiastically.
                <br><br>
                “Don’t join. The instructor is a pervert. I’ll teach you whenever you want” she said.
                <br><br>
                “You can swim?” I asked. She nodded.
                <br><br>
                “So do you accept my request to be your teacher?” Rose asked.
                <br><br>
                “Yes I do,” I said. She clapped her hands.
                <br><br>
                “Very good”. She came and sat next to me. I turned my body a bit to face her. We stared at each other without blinking. Her eyes looked down now, resting on my neck. She brought her hands to my neck and was about to unbutton my shirt before I stopped her. “What are you doing?” I asked.
                <br><br>
                “Relax. I want to see your necklace” she laughed.
                <br><br>
                “Oh,” I said, embarrassed. She unbuttoned the first two buttons and took the locket hanging from the long chain.
                <br><br>
                “Can I open it?” She asked before proceeding. I nodded. She opened the locket.
                <br><br>
                “Are these your parents?” She asked.
                <br><br>
                “Yeah,” I croaked.
                <br><br>
                “They are beautiful,” she said, still looking at the pictures in the locket.
                <br><br>
                “Thank you. They’re not together anymore though that’s why I keep them in this necklace, the only place they can be together with me” I said.
                
                <br><br>
                
                One of the things I envied the most about Rose’s life was her relationship with her family. She came from the most loving tight-knit family. I didn’t know if I wanted to be her or if I was jealous of her. Or if I wanted her and everything she had.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Part 4. Days of Heaven
                <br>
                I became Rose’s shadow. Not in a bad way. She wasn’t dimming my light or taking the spotlight away from me. I was no star, she was the star. I just followed her everywhere she went, I saw her more than I saw my own face. Life becomes different when you have someone that makes you excited to wake up in the morning. Before I met Rose, I used to pray for death in my sleep. I thought nothing was worse than waking up in the morning to face yet another bleak uneventful day. How glad I am now that God did not answer my prayers. I thought I was incapable of having a significant female friendship until I met Rose. What we had was meaningful and delicate. When we were together, we tried our best to be the best versions of ourselves we could be. It wasn’t because we didn’t want to show our flawed sides to each other, it was because everything bad in us disappeared in the presence of one another. Only the pure and good rose to the surface. It felt good depending on her because I knew she would never let me down. It was like having a dog and knowing it would never bite you.
                <br><br>
                
                
                We eventually introduced our families to each other. When we went on vacation, we met up several times to hang out and talked on the phone all the time. Rose was everything to me. And she never made me doubt my importance in her life. I saw how happy I made her and that encouraged me to continue making her happy. And as for me, the only thing that made me happy was making Rose happy. So I’d forever be happy as long as she let me made her happy.
                
                
                <br><br>
                Part 5. The Dance
                <br>
                The dance was the first major event we had after the holidays. Almost everyone had dates and I agreed to go with a boy in my class. I didn’t really want to but I hated to be the odd one out. Rose made sure I brought a dress from home by calling my mother to remind me about the dance. I got a blue ball dress that stopped just above my ankles. It was a strapless dress originally but my mom had a tailor sew on sleeves with a similar blue fabric. It looked ugly and Nina ripped them off the minute she saw them in my suitcase. I felt beautiful in the dress. For the first time in my life, I didn’t want to hide myself. I stared in the mirror and liked what was looking back. My braids were in a bun and I wore dangling earrings. I held a clutch that had nothing inside. It was as useless as the monarch of England.
                
                
                <br><br>
                Rose was in ravishing red. Fitted from head to toe with slim straps to hold the dress up. Half of her hair was up and half was down, the braids falling over her eyes so she could brush them away nonchalantly with her hands whenever they irritated her, which made her even more alluring than she already was.
                <br><br>
                I was bored at the dance and I could sense my date getting impatient with me by the minute. He kept dropping hints for me to join him on the dance floor but I played dumb. He sighed and said, “can we please dance?” I said I didn’t want to. “Well I’ll go find someone else then if you don’t,” he said. “You’re welcome” I answered. “Fuck you,” he said and got up. “Fuck you too!” I yelled back at him. I was frustrated with myself. This wasn’t what I wanted. I wanted to leave because I wasn’t with who I wanted to be with. I saw Nina having the time of her life with her date on the dance floor. Seeing her happy immediately brought a smile to my face. Her hands in the air, every strand of her braid was down now, bouncing up and down occasionally. I envied the boy that made her that happy. I wanted to kill him. Or be him. I didn’t know which one. I stood up and started moving across the hall. The disco lights changing from blue to red to purple to green, the music deafening and the temperature getting higher as each minute passed by. I inched slowly towards them, bobbing my head to the music like a hippie at a rave. I didn’t stop until I was behind Rose. I decided to join in the dance. “Nina, come on dance with us” Rose plopped me in the middle of her and the boy. She was jumping up and down, holding his hands as I was left trying to catch up in the middle. I separated his hands from hers and held hers in mine. It was my turn. “I’m getting tired” she yelled in my ear. It was like the universe was on my side as the DJ changed the up-tempo song to a slow jam. Suddenly the mood in the room dropped from the high energy to a lethargic romantic one.
                
                
                <br><br>
                “I love this song” she smiled.
                <br><br>
                “I love it too,” I said.
                <br><br>
                “Where’s your date?” She asked.
                <br><br>
                “He abandoned me,” I said.
                <br><br>
                “What an asshole. Well, I’ll dance with you. Fuck boys. You’ll dance with your friend. He can go to hell” she gripped me by the waist. “Thank you” I whispered in her ear as we danced.
                <br><br>
                “Can I lay my head on your shoulders? I’m tired” Said Rose.
                <br><br>
                “Yes, you can” you can stay like that till eternity if you want Rose. I’ll be there to hold you and not get fatigued no matter how long. I said with my touch. So we danced the night away. The DJ noticed how everyone was enjoying the slow romantic songs and he played them all night. It was the best night of my life so far.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Back in her room, as we lay in the dark, still in our dresses, she broke the news to me. I was staring at the ceiling, replaying the events of the night in my head. She started tracing her fingers over my eyebrows. “Nina I have something to tell you” she said. “What is it?” I looked over at her. She looked sad. I sensed whatever she had to say wasn’t good. “I’m leaving this school in a month” she said. I quickly sat up. I felt my head roar and my guts churn. “What do you mean?” I asked.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “My father has been posted to a different country, we’re moving and I’m starting a new school,” said Rose.
                <br><br>
                “Why can’t they just leave you here, you can go to them during the holidays,” I said, with my voice breaking.
                <br><br>
                “They won’t. They’re already not fans of me being in a boarding school away from them, they can’t ever let me be in a different country from them” she said. I buried my face in my hands. I felt her hands on my shoulders. I brushed them away. “Nina are you okay?” She asked.
                <br><br>
                “What am I going to do with my life without you?” I asked her. I didn’t expect an answer. I just wanted to guilt her into staying even though I knew that wasn’t her decision to make. “You know I’d stay if I could Nina” she said. I stood up from the bed.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “You would if you knew how much you mean to me but you don’t. I always care about people more than they care about me. See me here, I will do anything for you. Anything. And I hate that I’m like this. But you….you don’t care. You’ll just forget me and move on with your life. I’m just another friend you made along the way. I, on the other hand, will think about you till the day I die. I’ll write about you. I’ll hope I stumble upon you one day but it won’t happen. I’ll just keep holding onto hope. I wish I never knew you. I wish you never talked to me. I wish you never lost your tie and took mine. I wish I never came to this school. I wish I didn’t fall in love way too easily. Goodbye Rose. I wish you the best” I said. Tears clouding my eyes. Rose was crying too. I wanted to leave at that point but I couldn’t leave knowing I made her cry like that.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “Rose?” I whispered. She looked up and extended her arms. “Please hold me. Please” she pleaded. I ran to her and took her in my arms. “I’m so sorry for saying those words. I’m so sorry” I cried in her arms.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Part 5.
                <br>
                I ran as fast as I could, Rose leading the way, my hand in hers. We had escaped from school on a Friday after classes at 12:30 pm. We stopped a taxi and told him to take us into the city. The first thing we did in the city was withdraw some cash from an ATM. Our next stop was the mall, Rose wanted to get new braids. “I want them pink today” she told the hairdresser. “And very large. I don’t have enough time to sit for the tiny ones” she added. Her hair wasn’t braided, it was in its natural short black form.
                <br><br>
                “No. Blue please. For me. Keep it blue” I said. She smiled and reached her hand out to me, I took it in mine and squeezed, not smiling back. It was our last day and I was finding it difficult to be happy.
                <br><br>
                After getting her hair done, we bought milkshakes and walked around the mall. “Let’s get bracelets. Matching bracelets. They can remind us of each other” she said clutching my arm enthusiastically. I looked at her stolidly. “I don’t want that” she let go of my arm and I walked away.
                
                <br><br>
                
                We sat in the taxi quietly. I was filled with rage and despair. What was in Nina’s heart? I didn’t know because I couldn’t look into her eyes so I was unable to tell.
                <br><br>
                
                
                “Stop here please “ Said Rose. The car stopped and she paid. We got down. She asked me to follow her and I obeyed. We walked into a karaoke bar. “This will be fun” she dragged me to the stage. She chose a song on the machine. “Remember our dance?” She said. It was the song we danced to at the school dance. I nod. She started singing. I wasn’t into it. She pinched my cheek as she sang, I flicked her hand away and she grabbed me by the waist. “Don’t break my heart Nina. Please. What do you want me to do?” She said. I didn’t answer. Her eyes filled up with tears and she got off the stage. She turned off the song and walked out of the store. I watched her go.
                
                
                <br><br>
                Part 6. Immediately after ”Part 1. The Taxi”
                <br><br>
                We came back to school and went to the dormitories. “Goodnight,” Rose said to me as we reached my door. I stopped by the door, my back to her. I wanted to apologize, ask her to forgive me and spend our last night together with each other, but I didn’t, I just stood there, tears stinging my eyes. I opened the door and shut it quickly, resting my back on the door as I breathed heavily. I knew she was still out there waiting for me to come to my senses and open the door. I didn’t. I heard her footsteps fade away as she left for her room. I burst into silent tears, my chest on fire. I couldn’t help but resort to loud uncontrollable sobs. My roommate just turned restlessly on her bed and tried to cover her ears with a pillow, indifferent to whatever pain I was going through.
                <br><br>
                
                
                I had a shower. A hot one. I let the water run down my body as I stood still. I immediately went to bed after showering, fatigued from the events of the day. My dreams were permeated with Rose. They didn’t feel like dreams at all, they were like film reels replaying our best moments. Well, every moment with Rose was the best moment, but the dreams chose certain memories to replay. When I ultimately stirred and woke up after the sun hit my eyes, I saw Rose’s face looking down on me. With the light beams bouncing off her face, she looked like a celestial creature and I thought I had died and she was the angel receiving me in heaven. “Hey,” I said. “What are you doing here?”
                
                <br><br>
                
                “I’ve been watching you sleep” said Rose.
                <br><br>
                “For how long?” I asked.
                <br><br>
                “Maybe four hours or more” she said.
                <br><br>
                “Why?”
                <br><br>
                “I wanted to memorize your face. I don’t want to ever forget it” Rose said. I sat up, lost for words. How do you reply to something like that “But I gave you my pictures…you can look at them anytime” I said. 
                <br><br>
                “I want to remember a real, breathing, and moving face, not a snapshot of a single moment,” Rose said. I smiled and averted my eyes.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “I don’t want you to go” I started tearing up.
                <br><br>
                “I know. Oh Nina I don’t want to go too” she got on the bed and held my hands. “I wish we could promise to find each other someday but I don’t want to burden you with that,” said Rose. I wanted the same too and it wouldn’t be a burden on me. But I understood what she meant. We make many promises like that in our lives with no real intentions to keep them, and sometimes we do intend to keep them but over time the urgency to slowly disappears and we’re left feeling guilty for at least not even trying to keep the promise.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “I want to say I’ll call you every day when I get back home but I don’t know if I would. I don’t want us to lie to each other” I said.
                <br><br>
                “We still have some time left, can I just lie here with you?” Said Rose.
                
                <br><br>
                
                “Yes”. A thousand times yes. I moved to create space for her and she lied down next to me. I lied down too and met her eyes, holding the gaze and scared to blink, as if she might disappear if I looked away for a second. Whenever I remembered that moment, I couldn’t exactly pinpoint how long we stared into each other’s eyes before falling asleep. Was it a few seconds or was it forever? I didn’t care to know because all that mattered were those ocean eyes of hers, and every day I go through life with the faintest burning flame of hope in my heart that one day I’ll fall into them and get lost again.
                
                
                <br><br>
                When the time came for her to leave, I held her longer than I’ve ever held anyone in my life. I eventually let go and let her enter the car. I watched their car vanish into the distance and it felt like my life drifted away from me. My lips trembled and my knees began to wobble. I steadied myself and walked back to my room. I lied down on the bed. I felt something under my back. I got up and checked what it was. It was a white envelope. I opened it. A fake blue rose fell out. I picked it up. There was something else in the envelope, a letter. It read :
                <br><br>
                “the rose is for you so you don’t forget me. And I took something from you. Come find it one day. It’ll be around my neck. By then we’ll both be ready for each other”
                
                <br><br>
                
                I was confused by what the letter meant. What did she take from me? I touched my neck. I didn’t feel a chain around it. I quickly searched for the locket before realizing it was gone. She took it while I was asleep. I started laughing, tears sliding down the corners of my eyes. So I wasn’t crazy all along. She knew what it all meant. Everything we had, felt, shared and didn’t say, she knew what they meant. We weren’t ready then but when we meet again, I’ll never let her go.

            <h4>Jimmy Fahey wasn’t my best friend in London, that was Pat from Cork. Nor did he keep in touch once I followed my wife back to Ireland, though he promised he would. But he was the most memorable of my London friends; I imagine because of what he and his family had gone through. Course, for all I know, he might have moved home himself since I left the city but I doubt it somehow. Jimmy had never anything good to say about Ireland.

                <br><br>
                
                It wasn’t difficult, in the end, for me to go home. My wife inherited a house, we had the four kids and what was I at in London? Still fucking around Gospel Oak and Queens Crescent, that’s what.  So I had to move back, really. In time, the children did well at school and my wife became less pensive than she’d been in England. I didn’t put up a fight about the move, though I do still have a fondness for my London days – even the worst of them, the most lonely and desperate. They were a lot more interesting than those I’ve had in the dour small town I ended up in. But I can’t do much about it all now that’s for sure.
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                Jimmy I met at the Dogs in White City. He was from Limerick, which he’d left when he was fourteen, though you wouldn’t have guessed this from the freshness of his accent. An emerging star in the world of building contracting in London, he was known for two other things besides his building skills: his towering presence, and for having every one of his siblings living beside him in Cricklewood. In fact, one of them, I believe, lived in the same street. No need to go home, Con, he would say, not when the whole lot of them are here with me now. His love for his siblings was such that he set them all up with jobs and places to stay upon arrival in London, so that there wasn’t a day they had to struggle, not at first anyway. And there were six or seven of them I think. Anyway, when I first met him, I knew he was unlike me and the rest of the Irish lads we hung about with. The rest of us were not at all settled; we had dreams of one sort or another, usually of going home (of course when I did return to Ireland I wanted to go straight back to London; that is how emigration works, it seems to me ). But Jimmy was determined and steady, and very settled. His family was close by, or near enough, and he loved London. He wasted no time with useless dreams of leaving it. However, everything changed after I knew the man five or six years.
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                His sister Carmel’s eight-year-old son Joseph went missing, and after a month looking for the boy (I myself went out on trips with Jimmy to parks all over the capital), the child’s body was found in a canal by King’s Cross. Let’s just say, he’d not fallen in. The bastard who did it was eventually got and sent to prison. The whole business cast a shadow over Jimmy for many years, as it did everyone in the Fahey family; he lost his business and soon left Construction altogether. At some point, a kind of acceptance came over him, so that those who met him years later could not believe there was this horrible story in the man’s background, though they would express their shock to me, or others, rarely to Jimmy himself.
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                As the years passed, Jimmy would look out for my own children – sensitive as he was, I suppose, to their fragile presence in this world. Always sweets and toys he bought them. And as a cab driver for many actors performing in the West End he would often be given free tickets to shows, and once, he personally brought my eldest to Aladdin On Ice, and she was never to forget Jim’s kindness. Then, twelve or so years after the arrest of little Joseph’s killer, I began to see another change in my friend. He became this time markedly sullen, withdrawn. I thought it might have been the nightshifts he was working in his cab. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                ‘What’s up Jimmy,’ I said.
                
                <br>
                ‘Ah, it’s McHugh. He’s getting out in the summer,’ he said, his face ashen.
                
                <br>
                ‘Fuck,’ I said, and put my hand on the man’s shoulder. The power of his strong frame was palpable beneath my fingers. 
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                For months then, whenever I would meet him at the Dogs or in the Black Star - the bar I worked at in Kilburn - he would have the same depressed look on him, as if Joseph’s disappearance was happening all over again. He was not just morose but distracted when he’d talk. He became strangely precise in his habits. Only one pint when in the past he might have had three or more. He looked firmer in his body, too, wiry, as if he’d been working out. I began to think that this mild-mannered giant, for he was over 6ft 6 inches (in another life, or some macabre story perhaps, Jimmy might have been something of a circus attraction), was planning something. I went straight for the jugular:
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                ‘You’re not thinking of doing anything to that McHugh are you?’ I knew by him that he understood perfectly what I meant.
                
                <br>
                ‘Can’t talk about it, Con,’ he said.  ‘Less you know the better.’ Which, as far as I was concerned, meant he was planning something. Possibly in cahoots with members of his own family. His brothers maybe. I can’t say I blamed him at all. I would have joined them if he’d asked me.
                
                <br>
                ‘They will be watching you,’ I said. ‘The Police. They’ll know you’ll be wanting to do things to the bastard. Don’t be stupid.’
                
                <br>
                ‘Say no more,’ Jimmy said.  
                
                
                
                <br><br>
                Around June then, just before McHugh’s release, Jimmy came in to see me again in The Black Star. He sat upon his usual stool. This time he was more vivacious, the colour returned to his fat dimpled cheeks. It was a joy to see him this way after all the pain he’d gone through, especially of late, no doubt having to revisit in his mind the time of his nephew’s disappearance and vile demise. I thought perhaps he’d made some kind of peace with the news of McHugh’s imminent release.
                
                
                <br><br>
                
                ‘What’s up now, Jimmy,’ I said.
                <br>
                ‘Ah you won’t believe me.’
                <br>
                ‘Come on. I hope it’s nothing to do with you know who.’ Jimmy shook his head.
                <br>
                ‘No Con, nothing to do with that. I’m driving a Hollywood star around the place for the next few weeks. She asked especially for me as I had her in the cab once before and we hit it off that time.’
                <br>
                ‘Who is it,’ I asked, ‘Marylyn Monroe?’ Jimmy licked his lips and pulled forwards across the bar.
                
                <br><br>
                
                ‘No. Actually, it’s Lauren Bacall. And she’s working on a film in London, and I’m her driver.’ I can be the jealous type; always a bit bitter about my wholesale failure in that wonderful city I’ve long since left but I was not bitter about, or jealous of, Jimmy’s news. He had often celebrities in his cab, though I did not remember him telling me about his earlier stint with Bacall. I would have remembered that. So this was good news indeed. Some excitement and glamour (if only reflected) for the man at last. If anyone deserved a boost it was he. I’ve often thought since that had circumstances been different, Jimmy himself might have done well in Hollywood. A handsome enough man, he was always drawn to theatre and musicals, and loved and had great knowledge of the old black and white films, the movie stars of old, so this gig was right up his street.
                
                <br><br>
                
                ‘What’s she like?’ I said.
                <br>
                ‘So far, she’s a sassy one. Gives me the low down on all the actors she’s working with. Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney. Adores the director.’
                <br>
                ‘What’s the film, did she say?’
                <br>
                ‘Some Agatha Christie story. Murder on the Orient Express, I think it is.’
                <br>
                ‘Does she ask you about your life?’
                <br>
                ‘She does.’
                <br>
                ‘Did you tell her about Joseph?’
                <br>
                ‘I did. And she went all quiet when I told her.’
                <br>
                ‘A real life murder that’s why. These celebrities are shielded from that you know, real life.’
                <br>
                ‘Aye,’ Jimmy said, returning to his stout.
                <br>
                ‘I suppose you didn’t tell her about a certain plan you seemed to be cooking up back there?’
                <br>
                ‘Course I fucking didn’t,’ Jimmy said. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Over the next few weeks, whenever he came into the pub he’d be glowing. He’d tell me about what new star he’d met at Elstree, who else had been in the cab with Lauren Bacall, who, he said, had booked him to chauffeur her to shoots, interviews and restaurants for the period of three weeks around London. He said she had a great sense of humour and talked politics with him non-stop, and that Vanessa Redgrave and she had hit it off, were two rebels, two peas in a pod. Both women, he said, had ‘a compelling sense of justice.’
                <br>
                ‘I let her smoke in the car, too. Maureen says I reek,’ Jimmy said. ‘And you know, you were right, Con.’ I looked at him, quizzically. ‘I did tell her - Lauren, that is - what we were planning to do to McHugh.’ He seemed unfazed by the revelation.
                <br><br>
                
                
                ‘So yez are doing something. What she say to that?’
                <br>
                ‘She said I don’t blame you but it isn’t smart.’
                <br>
                ‘Yeah?’
                <br>
                ‘Yeah.’
                <br>
                ‘Well she’s right.’
                <br>
                ‘Course she is. She’s Lauren Bacall.’ Jimmy smiled as he dove his lips into the black of his pint. I should have suspected then that some other plan was afoot, but I let it go, stupidly perhaps. I don’t know why I should have suspected this, except that Jimmy seemed so particularly unruffled, more cocksure than his usual quietly-confident self – the spectre of McHugh no longer haunting him as plainly as it had. When I’d originally envisaged the Fahey family taking revenge, I thought it might be a case of roughing McHugh up. But the Faheys were not really fighters, let alone killers, so I decided not to fret unduly about my friend’s intentions, which, he insisted, he no longer had.
                <br><br>
                
                
                By the end of July, of course, McHugh was dead. He’d been hit at high speed by a car, which had driven over his body several times, and with such brutal force, the man had been decapitated. It had happened at night on a leafy street in Muswell Hill, and the car was not seen or reported. The police went to see Jimmy immediately, knowing he was a cabbie, knowing he and the other men, and women, of the Fahey family had a serious gripe with McHugh. But Jimmy had a cast-iron alibi, which the police had double-checked more times than was needed, no doubt to glimpse again the smoky-voiced goddess of “Old Hollywood” and of films they’d grown up with: Lauren Bacall had confirmed that at the time the hit-and-run was supposed to have happened, Jimmy Fahey had been driving her from a late-night cigarette and whiskey run. He was her driver after all. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Before I left London, finally, to go back to Ireland, the greatest regret of my life I must say, I met with Jimmy one last time. We shared a pot of tea in Venus Café in Kilburn. Jimmy seemed aloof; he looked out constantly at the new rowan saplings being planted on the verges of the Kilburn High Road.  When I told him about my wife’s inheritance he passed no remarks. I didn’t feel easy enough with him to mention the dead McHugh. I tried to give him money I owed him but he wouldn’t accept it. Jimmy said he would visit me in Ireland, but he, like Pat from Cork, and most of my London friends, never did. Though he did tell me he’d quit cabbing, that after driving Lauren Bacall around for three weeks he could hardly go back to teenagers vomiting in the back of his Mercedes on Saturday nights. Though I heard he did eventually go back to it, and I believe was hired again by Ms. Bacall. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                
                
                We shook hands when we left each other, and I realised then it was the first time we’d ever done that, touched each other’s skin sort of. His hands were gentle and soft, I noticed, his shake limp, which, I remember thinking, from a powerful big-boned man like Jimmy was unexpected. Everyone I knew, including my own wife, thought it was Jimmy who’d ploughed over McHugh, but once I’d shaken the man’s hand I was not so sure. Though, over time, I’ve come to understand that there are people in this life who are capable of putting aside their own nature, good or bad, for something they perceive as more important, such as love, or family perhaps.<br><br></h4>

            <h4>The smile she holds on her lips is like mashed red pepper, it begins to get uncomfortable after a while. Amenze watches the city fixtures – the two-stories, the three-stories, the high rises, the filling stations, the shopping complexes, the electric poles and the cellular towers – do their morning sprints with a purpose she could only imagine.

                <br><br>
                
                She has been wearing her usual smile since she got into the car – a smile that doesn't extend any graciousness to her slanted eyes – because Monday, her husband, has declared with an unfazed shrug that he does not have the money for her today. That is the declaration he voiced but not the only one she heard.
                
                <br><br>
                
                They are sitting side by side in his old Corolla – Monday driving himself to work and Amenze, to her mother's. Occasionally when he has to halt for traffic, he turns to her and stares. She wonders what he thinks of her smiling in spite of his insufferable attitude towards her. Does he think, she wonders, that this epitomizes my life in this marriage which has been to smile in spite of everything?

                "What?" he asks, not because he hasn't heard her clearly but because he wants her to talk some more.
                
                <br><br>
                
                She doesn't say anything because she will not, for the life of her, oblige him this blessed morning. She turns away instead to the fleeting scene of two women fighting in a street corner. Ehn ehn, this early morning, she thinks. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Monday makes a humph as he eyes the rowdy scene of the women’s nakedness on the side mirror; wrappers and braziers have been torn and are sprawled carelessly in the heat of the ensuing brawl. A crowd has quickly formed and encircles the belligerent pair in a cheering ring. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                "You are doing this thing again," Monday begins to say. They had driven in silence for a considerable length of time within which he had toyed with the dial of the car radio which now broadcast muffled voices from a morning drive show. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                When she does not respond, he continues: "you act like it's my fault that I don't have any money today, when you told me about the money you needed for the store today, did I not tell you that I will try my best, why are you so bent on not understanding? Ehn? You women."
                
                <br><br>
                
                "And you men," she says in a half-shout, clearly unable to remain silent, "is it today I've been talking about opening a store? How about when Junior was born? Or after Angel? Why is there always something convenient for you to say when I ask for money to start a business? Why don’t you ever support me?"
                
                <br><br>
                
                Amenze had seen the ‘For Let’ sign in front of one of the stores of the shopping complex she’d had her eyes on for a while – it fit her desires to the T. She liked that the complex was very accessible from the main road and consciously built for businesses (unlike others she’d seen); she found the spacious and well-ventilated stores to her taste (she’d even made friends with some of the renters just to get a feel of these), and she’d marveled at the upper-middle-class clientele the complex managed to attract. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Almost five months ago, she’d seen all this and the vision for her beauty salon and spa had taken shape. Such a good place had the obvious catch though – they had run out of stores to let as soon as they’d put word out. It was therefore providence that an occupant was giving up their spot to join their family abroad. 
                
                
                <br><br>
                On the advice of one of her new friends, Amenze had met the manager to declare interest and he’d really liked her beauty spa idea – no current seller was doing that in the complex. He’d been gracious enough to give her a week to make a down payment for the store but now, Monday was doing his thing.
                <br><br>
                
                
                She looks out the window as a traffic light turns red. An old man with a megaphone is screaming repent pugnaciously. Monday does not say anything for a while, just looks from the dashboard to the side mirror and she wonders in the noisome silence of his car, not for the first time, why the distance from their home to her mother's is such a journey. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Her mother, ever on her neck to give up housewifeship, had been elated at the news of the opening and had offered to invest with first year’s rent but Amenze had declined. She hadn’t wanted to take her mother’s money even in the guise of a loan.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Although Amenze didn’t tell her mother, she’d declined simply because she didn’t want to anger Monday who did not like her mother’s constant talk of financial independence for her daughter. As he’d often told her, he was a ‘traditional African man’ and could provide for his family.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Moreover, he’d expressly told her that if she was going to engage in any enterprise, it would be under his full supervision. So she’d honestly thought Monday would have been enthusiastic about the opportunity – he was after all always investing in the ideas of his friends and kinsmen.  
                <br><br>
                
                
                  Monday suddenly speaks – softly: "things are hard now, I want you to start the business, you think I don't but come off it. When Junior was born, yes, I know I told you to nurse him first and after that, you know that's when I lost that job with Strait Construction."
                
                <br><br>
                
                “And all the many years after?” Amenze is suddenly very tired of his histrionics, "you got another job, got a car, two or three promotions but anytime I bring up the business issue, you have one excuse or the other and that’s why we are stagnant. No one can do it alone anymore. I mean what have we achieved? Do you think about that? We are still paying house rent while power couples are moving into their second houses…"
                
                <br><br>
                
                "See, I don't even want you doing that business that attracts those low-life gossipy types, let's plan big, you know, open a supermarket." 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Amenze laughs a bitter laugh, an old, well-worn anger beginning to clothe her chest. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                "Eh, you know, all that dirty salon life is not what I want for you, trust me, I'll surprise you."
                
                
                <br><br>
                She smiles at the irony, a hmm escaping with her breath, "you have surprised me enough," she says slowly, almost sadly, "to think you have the guts to mention supermarket. You think I don't know.” She didn’t know: was merely working on a nagging suspicion.
                
                <br><br>
                
                "Know what?" he asks, looking at her strangely. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                "You think I'm stupid?" she hisses.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Amenze looks at him again, fishing, wondering if she should voice her misdoubts; how she should voice her misdoubts, "you think I don't know you opened a supermarket for that Precious lady?"
                
                <br><br>
                Some time while they had been talking, he had rolled up the windows because as she delivers this, her words bounce about the car, perhaps desperate for a way out. The voices from the radio have stopped talking altogether: replaced by a faint static sound. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                "I have not seen her since that time," he stutters, referring to that time she had caught them leaving a hotel together, that time that he’d replaced her beautiful smiles with these imitations, that time she’d been told to fight, with prayer and subservience as is expected of a good wife for her man because a she-devil had entrapped her innocent husband in an inextricable entanglement. She’d wondered why she was the one who had to do something about his unfaithfulness. Did everyone think it was somehow her fault that his eyes could be turned by another?
                
                <br><br>
                
                "You must not believe everything your friends tell you, eh” he continues to say, assuming she’d heard it from people around, by so doing, confirming that there was some truth to it, “most of them are jealous of you and want to spoil your marriage, I mean, where will I get the money to open a supermarket on my salary, you still be reasoning now.”
                <br><br>
                
                
                If she had merely heard it from friends, she would have written it off as silly hearsay but she had seen the loan approval document in his drawer as well as a title deed to land, just before a friend had called her to say that Monday’s girlfriend had opened a supermarket. Now that she thinks about it, she hadn’t really looked at the documents but the coincidence had been too much - he’d borrowed money, had bought land and his gal had opened a supermarket.
                
                <br><br>
                
                It did not hurt her when it crossed her mind that he had secretly opened the business for his darling Precious – she was done fighting that hopeless fight – but that he had obtained a loan in this economy, further complicating their financial position and jeopardizing the future of her children – that had scared her. She no longer wanted to be under the mercies of a man who wasn’t thinking straight.
                
                <br><br>
                
                She looks at him, her eyes filling with irritating tears; her lips twitching with disbelief, pain, and regret. Anger crawls gleefully on her skin and all her emotions tighten to a choke, and then suddenly she heaves and says, "I saw the documents, you took a loan for your girlfriend, how thoughtless?”
                
                <br><br>
                
                Monday turns to her briefly and then back at the road: "I was going to surprise you, but that's not for her, it’s our land, I'm building a house for us."
                <br><br>
                
                
                Amenze’s face crumples. She can see that he expects that she must now realize that all her worries and complaints are suddenly invalidated by his revelation; that even though she’d given eleven years of her life in marriage to him, his decision to solely undergo a building project without so much as a word to her must suddenly make up for his cheating and emotional manipulations, for the financial sabotage all through the years.
                
                <br><br>
                
                There and then, she decides she had been wrong about her marriage. Here she’d thought there was still something worth keeping. Yes, she was in it with a domineering cheat; a ‘traditional African man’ but she’d actually believed that at his core, he wasn’t that backward. Early in their marriage, he’d really seen her; he’d listened to her talk about her aspiration with a light of admiration that had emboldened her.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Now, it was apparent that she had never really seen him as anything but that man who’d shared in her dreams all those years ago. The manipulation and cheating, those she’d rationalized as a temporary slip-up; something to be blamed on the pressures of the world that plagues the man. Now, she understood that the biggest manipulation was that, in spite of all he’d done, she’d still thought the world of him.
                
                <br><br>
                
                She could see now that there was no use holding him to any standard, no point agonizing over his philandering, wondering where the loving husband she married had gone to for he was right there sitting with her in his old Corolla, just no longer loving. There was no family peace to worry about sullying and no love to put into consideration; everything healthy and desirable in their marriage had at some point in the eleven years been washed off like vomit from a bib.
                
                <br><br>
                
                But there were her children to consider. And there was she to think of. There and then, she decided – she would start her business without him, because she could, thank God she could. She would take the money her mother had offered, start her spa and no bloody man would be able to stop her. She smiles – a true smile this time; one that reaches and conquers her eyes; one that stretches her lips into a victorious rictus – a miracle she hadn’t thought she was capable of.

            <h4>Shola searched through the top drawer again. She ran her fingers through the underwear on the left side of the drawer where she knew Shade kept it. She looked through the second drawer, then the third. Still not finding it, she took a steadying breath. She knew where she needed to check next, but with the way her heart was drumming, she didn’t feel ready to. She heard movement outside the room and went toward it. In the living room, Shina was heading toward the front door, clutching a piece of notebook paper that held spoonfuls of Milo he had nabbed from Mummy’s room.  
                <br><br>
                
                
                “Shina!”
                <br><br>
                He jumped. His fear quickly replaced with annoyance that his sister had startled him unnecessarily. 
                <br><br>
                “Ehn?”
                <br><br>
                “Have you seen Sister Shade?”
                <br><br>
                “No.” 
                <br><br>
                “No since when?”
                <br><br>
                “Since morning when she went with Brother Kehinde.”
                <br><br>
                “Kehinde.” She murmured. She felt dizzy and couldn’t probe Shina for more details before he disappeared, eager to share his loot with the others. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Shola blew some air into her blouse and made her way to the dark kitchen. She opened the fridge and felt her way past the pot of stew and the black bags of Ugwu to find the glass bottle of Coke she hid there last night. She went back into the living room looking for a bottle opener and found one on a pile of old newspapers. Sitting on the arm of her father’s chair, she opened the drink and took long gulps. She concentrated on the sweetness of the fizzy drink and her gratitude for it. She set down the half-drunk bottle and returned to the room. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                She walked past her bed to Shade’s. She knelt before the bed for a moment, imagining what she hoped to find. A battered blue suitcase that Tolani exchanged for Shade’s equally shabby black box. The roommates had switched boxes and wished each other good luck for the road ahead. She imagined its contents. Two of Shade’s nicest pairs of jeans, eight blouses, her sturdiest court shoes, a corduroy blazer and a new, hideous but thick jacket, a small bottle of anointing oil that Mummy had given to her the night before, letters from Kunle and Laide, an envelope holding pictures of herself, family and friends, a towel and a new notebook. She looked under the bed and her heart sank. She fell into a sitting position, hugging her legs. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                She sat thinking about what Shade could be doing. She would have reached Lagos by now, traffic or no traffic. She would stay in a trusted friend’s house overnight, too excited to sleep, reciting the plan in her head, going over the ticket details. Silently, she’d practice the answers to the questions she was told she’d be asked. She imagined Shade getting ready. The mechanical shower, dressing in her favorite jeans, a blue chiffon shirt that she had only ever worn two months ago on her 25th birthday, a blazer, and the brown leather court shoes. She would leave for the airport at noon, though her flight was at 11:45 pm. It was then that the images in Shola’s mind blurred. This was as far as her imagination would take her. She had never been to the airport before. Her imaginations from then on would be of her sister in places and in situations she knew nothing about. It was with this thought that Shola burst into tears.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Shortly after, Mummy returned home and came into the room. She was shocked to find her usually stoic daughter sobbing in the dark. Shola tried to speak, but couldn’t get past a few syllables before her words were swallowed by her sobs. Mummy brought Shola to her feet and wiped her  shaking daughter’s wet face with a white handkerchief. With an empathetic smile, Mummy said to her, “Ọmọ mi. Ma sọkun mọ. O shi ku.” There is more. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                ~
                
                
                <br><br>
                Shade and Kehinde approached the airport in his ratty blue Peugeot. Shade’s heart was beating hard and fast. The uncomfortable rhythm had started since they left Anu’s apartment. Kehinde had assured her that she wouldn’t feel this way for the entire journey. She had taken his comforting words and turned back to her thoughts as he launched into a lecture on the fight or flight response. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                Kehinde squeezed her knee to get her attention. “I’ll drop you in front, I’ll go and park, then  I’ll meet you inside.”
                
                
                <br><br>
                Shade responded in a cold voice, “Don’t bother. In fact, forget about me and don’t contact me ever again.” She got out of the car and grabbed the suitcase from the backseat. She wove between vehicles, lugging her box and refusing to look back. Kehinde strove to be a practical man who avoided dramatic scenes if he could help it. So no, he would not leave his car in the middle of traffic to chase after a woman that had stormed out. So he watched her make her way toward the airport and waited for the traffic to ease so he could make a u-turn. 
                <br><br>
                
                
                Shade let her tears fall freely as she found her way to the terminal she would be leaving from. She asked around and found that she was a few hours too early for check-in, so she dragged her bag to a quieter section of the waiting area. She sat next to an elderly woman wearing a head tie that did not match her blouse and a blouse that did not match her wrapper. The woman smiled as she approached and Shade offered a weak smile in response. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                She sat studying the procedure of an earlier flight which had already begun its check-in. She saw him then. In his ridiculous pink shirt and oversized jeans. He squinted at the terminal number, recognizing it, he spun around, looking for her. He found her sitting with her box resting in front of her. She had tired eyes and she anxiously bounced her right leg. Kehinde sat next to her and playfully nudged her knee with his own, and Shade leaned into him. He greeted the colorfully dressed woman and the teenager escorting her. Natural to Kehinde, his greeting leads to a lengthy conversation. They discussed the terrible traffic to the airport, the differences between her village in Enugu, and this loud insane maze of a place that she has found herself. She had come to see her first son off. He left about an hour ago, but she wanted to wait a while longer. She wasn’t sure which direction would take her a little closer to her son and which would take her further, so she decided she’d just stay where she was for a little while longer as he flew away. They waited together. Kehinde occasionally got up to stretch his legs and to buy them water. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                After an hour, Mama felt ready to leave. She prayed for them and wished Shade a safe flight. “When you return, you both should come and look for me in Umuakpu”. They smiled and assured her that they would. They watched her slowly make her way with her escort. Shade and Kehinde remained, holding hands and waiting.

                Shola stared at the picture. It was a glossy picture of her sister with a large smile, dressed in a pink snowsuit and a matching hat. She was standing in front of an apartment building surrounded by so much snow. She traced Shade’s face with her finger and tried to reconcile the familiar face with the incongruously unfamiliar outfit and environment. She began to write a response to Shade’s letter. On the thin sheet of paper, she began to offload all the things she had wanted to rush home to tell her.

                    <br>
                           how like seeds, your mother spewed them out on your soil.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    
                    & the breeze that day was a cushion for your body 
                    <br>
                         with the walls of your house making sure they're balls into your net. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    your memory will picture her bright ankara wrapper, 
                    <br>
                           how they perfectly captured your essence - a ripe fruit in many eyes. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    she'll tell you about the  birds that will set their sights on you, 
                    <br>
                           the same way they hovered above her when she was in your light. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I'm certain, your lips will move, they'll form a smile, 
                    <br>
                          with thoughts about how her tone rose on certain phrases 
                    <br>
                                    & fell on others.

                    these words, you'll hold firmly like a wristband - small yet conspicuous, 
                    <br>
                          then time will make it a hijab, then, a dress, then your skin. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    you'll make yourself a Sunday, these words, into a church
                    <br>
                            & no soup you prepare in life, won't have a dash of them. 
                    <br><br>
                    
                    
                    Ẹniọlá, one day, you'll remember your mother engraved your name 
                    <br>
                            into the essence of these words, 
                    <br>
                                     for the world to see your wonders wander.

                    & that, one day, you'll also spread these  exact same seeds
                    <br>
                                  on the soils of the beautiful souls you'll beget.
