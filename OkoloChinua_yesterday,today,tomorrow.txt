Yesterday births today with a smile,
The leaves turn towards heaven in joy
And the breeze slitters round and round in a warm embrace.
Yesterday, a man walked past and called his silence a disease,
A mother closed her eyes and woke up to see her eyes closed,
A father dug the earth and brought forth sand,
A boy crosses the road, his legs do not reach the other side
<br>
<br>
Memories,
Yesterday we existed,
Yesterday we woke up to hear that Akachi lives only in his works,
that rainbows bleed faces when pricked,
Yesterday, smoke rose in the distance, today we find a fire
<br>
<br>
Memories,
Today births a smile,
And though death begins with D the C that runs before it shall not hold us down,
Today births a smile,
Tomorrow will be better.
