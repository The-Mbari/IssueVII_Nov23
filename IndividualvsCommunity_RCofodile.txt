Among my race, it’s sounded like a gong<br>
‘One cannot be right, and society, wrong.’<br><br>

Some tribes killed twins, deemed theirs abnormal birth,<br>
circumcised girls, what misery to provoke,<br>
tortured widows, left widowers untouched.<br>
Columbus proved the Spaniards’ view a joke;<br>
the truth they knew was that the world was flat!<br>
A continent from slavery’s thrall awoke<br>
when Frederick Douglas rose against the scourge.<br>
With birth control did Marie Stopes provoke<br>
the wrath of realms which later practised it.<br>
By seeking fellow women to unyoke<br>
did Mary Wollstonecraft enrage the world…<br>
The list of those who public’s rules revoke<br>
then lives uplift, is one without an end.<br>
Minorities endure society’s yoke.<br>
It seems that much that’s wise or right evolved<br>
when one rebutted words society spoke.<br><br>

How wrong the view that’s sounded like a gong,<br>
‘One cannot be right, and society, wrong.’
