***
We slid along the seam of sunset’s pouch,
you bred with me a silly reverie,
deluxe psychedelics redefined our limits.
 
When innocence dined with us.
 
We brew ignorance as art,
glances stolen and dashed beyond will,
You age, now a woman at heart.
 
I’m exhausted beloved.
 
Reeking is a buffet of sweet talk,
riled up,
bouncing off teeth and gums is my truth as well,
inglorious is this dulcet tale.
 
At heart, I race still,
at cost, we stray still,
alas, evening delight lingers on lips still.
