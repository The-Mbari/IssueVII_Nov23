We are tired, of it all.
We are tired of the harassment.
We are tired of the oppression.
We are tired of insecurity.

We are hurt,
We are bitter, 
Our hearts are filled with sadness and grief
Therefore, we cry out loud, we scream ‘change.’ 

We want an end to this all,
For the lives you've taken, without any remorse.
For the pain you've caused families.

We remember them all,
We remember Tina, she was just 16.
We remember Ifeoma, she was raped and killed by YOU.
We remember Jimoh, he was far away from the action.
We remember Kolade Johnson.
The list could go on, we remember them, to remind you in case you forget.

We aren't asking for too much,
We aren't even asking for basic amenities, that'd be like us wishing for a 12-day old baby to talk.
We are simply asking to stay alive.
Very absurd, but that's it.
And we aren't stopping soon.

We want security.
We want peace.
We'll do all we can to get that,
And that's why we protest,
But this is more than just a protest, it's more than an objection.
It's the beginning of a revolution.
